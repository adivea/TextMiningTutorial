ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I came across the Castieau diaries while undertaking work on the history of
prisons in Australia some years ago. Financial support from an Australian
Research Council Small Grant with supplementary funds from Griffith
University enabled the transcription of the diaries and research into their
contexts. This work was largely undertaken in Brisbane at different times by
Christina Broad, Bronwyn Hammond, Margaret De Nooyer and Pamela
Murray. I am grateful to all of them for their careful attention and assistance
in this painstaking task. In Melbourne, Iris Petrass used her excellent archival
skills and personal knowledge of Victorian social history, including the
history of women?s imprisonment, to compile an indispensable guide to the
public record of Castieau?s employment in the Victorian prisons.
The research for the book started before the Internet existed in its current
form. By the time I had almost completed the manuscript I became
acquainted with the genealogical work on the Castieau family carried out
some years ago by lan Mackellar, a descendent, who has now made the work
available on the Web. Lan has been a good friend to the project and I thank
him for important information on the family history and for making some
rare photographs available for this volume. For their time and assistance, I am
grateful to Margaret Carlton, former manager at the Burke Museum in
Beechworth, site of the old Beechworth Athenaeum and its wonderful Burke
memorial window, whose design and installation was facilitated by Castieau;
and to Diane Gardiner, curator at the Old Melbourne Gaol Museum.
Without the resources of the National Library of Australia and the riches
of its manuscripts collection, the country would be poorer. I am grateful for
the continuing support of Graeme Powell, Manuscripts Librarian; to Paul
Hetherington, Director of Publications; and to Leora Kirwan, who has
expertly edited the manuscript to its final stage.
The book is dedicated to the memory of my father, Peter Kevin Finnane
(1926-2001), who often listened to my stories from Castieau and would
have enjoyed reading this original voice from nineteenth-century Melbourne.

INTRODUCTION
John Buckley Castieau was of the gold-rush generation, one of the many
thousands of young and anxious immigrants to Victoria in the early
1850s. They became builders of state and society, creating colonial
institutions in a British heritage but shaping them pragmatically to suit local
circumstances. Castieau?s historical significance is modest. Weighed on the
scales of historical attention against those many talented, ambitious and
successful peers of his generation, his name scarcely survives in the written
record of the times. What he left behind him however were the diaries he
kept over the three decades of his time in Victoria. As diaries can do, they
enliven our sense of urban life at a time of great creativity.
One of the earliest products of the nineteenth-century revolution in
government was the bureaucratic prison. In place of the eighteenth-century
institution, that barely kept the incarcerated separate from those outside, the
nineteenth-century prison was an enclosure peopled by inmates and staff
whose lives were ordered by an increasingly refined governmental apparatus.
There were careers made at all levels of this system, entire lives worked out
through a career as inmate, or as warder, as prison governor, or as matron.
Castieau became one of those who sought financial security in this service.
Victorias penal institutions were the product of an enthusiasm for
institution building that dominated the 1850s and early 1860s. By the time
fiscal exhaustion brought on a temporary halt there was already an enviable
list of major institutions ?gaols, hospitals and asylums?describing a carceral
map of Victoria. 1 Gaols and prisons would not attract the interest in the
twentieth century that they did in the nineteenth, as visible signs of order and
civilised accomplishment. When the celebrated English comic actor Charles
Mathews arrived in Melbourne in 1870 he was struck by colonial puffing
about such places, reflecting back to the members of the Yorick Club the
questions he typically faced:
?Are you not surprised at Melbourne?? How do you like our town??
?Have you seen our town-hall, our Parliament-houses ?and our gaol??
(Much laughter.) 2
The task of running such places was given to those who had come to the
colony expecting a fortune from gold, or simply a security from the
opportunities which gold would bring in its wake. We do not know exactly why

John Buckley Castieau came to Victoria but he was one of the generation born
in the 1820s and 1830s that migrated to the gold colony in the early 1850s,
becoming by the 1880s part of an official establishment whose triumphs were
celebrated at Melbourne's International Exhibition in 1880. 3 An inveterate diary
keeper, his surviving diary's first pages comment on the trials of the Eureka
rebels. By the time of his death in 1885 he had spent more than three decades
in the penal service, rising from warder to an unhappy and undistinguished
office as Inspector-General of Penal Establishments. Along the way he saw
service in the prisons of Melbourne and Beechworth, strolled the streets of the
city with Marcus Clarke, tolerated the pomposity of Judge Redmond Barry and
presided over the execution of Ned Kelly. It was a career that might suggest
potential for greater historical eminence. But Castieau was no pioneering penal
reformer, nor was he the epitome of the severe prison governor of his time. His
career was on the whole ordinary, with some notable downs as well as ups. His
commitment was to public service and his disposition was the exercise of
punishment with a sensitivity to human frailty, 'justice tempered with mercy' as
a group of life and long-sentence prisoners rhetorically memorialised at the end
of his long career. 4

What makes Castieau exceptional in the historical record is what he left
behind him?a collection of diaries that cover (intermittently) three decades
of his life as prison warder, governor and inspector-general; his years as a
young lad in the wild early days of the newly-separated colony; his
hypochondria; his feelings as a Victorian husband and father with a capacity
for ironic reflection on the relations of the sexes; and his experiences as an
urban clubman who read and conversed with some of the leading figures in
Victorian cultural life of the 1870s. The diaries are, above all, a vital record
of daily life in Melbourne during its years as one of the Empire?s leading
cities. As a rich domestic and professional daily record, they demand
attention beside other personal insights into colonial life, such as those of the
police functionary and clubman Frederick Standish, or even of the more
literary Annie Baxter Dawbin. 5
Castieau?s background is obscure?and across 30 years of diary writing
there is very little reference to his pre-Australian life. His marriage certificate
of 1858 reports his birth at Gosport, Hampshire in 1831, the son of a Major
John B. Castieau of Portsmouth and of Emma, nee Whitcombe. 6 He
migrated to Australia in 1852, accompanied by his sisters, 27-year-old
Harriette and 21 -year-old Emma, both of whom feature regularly in the early
diaries. 7 Their parents appear to have separated and the three emigrant
children kept contact with their father by regular correspondence. The fate of
their mother is unknown and unmentioned in the diaries, but the Major, as
Castieau refers to him, lived on to the age of 92, dying only three years before
Castieau in 1882.
Into the 1870s Castieau was still sending his father copies of The
Australasian , the illustrated Melbourne weekly, every month. The distance
between the children and parents seems greater than that between Australia
and ?Home?. Major Castieau had enlisted in the British Army during the
Napoleonic wars and had obtained successive promotions during a long
service with the Royal Marines. 8 He was periodically engaged in service in

(c.1765), married at St Anne?s Soho, Westminster, 1784 (information courtesy of lan
McKellar). William might be the William Castieau, author of the ?astonomical, mechanical

Spain and Portugal throughout the 1830s, that is during the first 10 years of
Castieau?s life. In the few references to his father in the diaries there is a good
deal of emotional tension ?and a distinct sense of inadequacy?when finally
a photo of a now 84-year-old ?hale, hearty, upright old chap? arrives in the
post in 1874 9 . For the rest, there is only silence.
There is no evidence of contact with the mother, but in 1870 Castieau was
ready enough to respond to a ?Mrs Castieau? from Nottingham who had
written claiming him as her son; they exchanged photographs but perhaps
nothing more. 10 He was, it appears, like many colonials, one whose voyage
across the world was a dramatic break with a childhood in another place, but
bearing the cultural baggage of that childhood and youth. There was some
family misfortune in the past, a hardship to which Castieau alludes in 1855,
chastising himself for ?foolishly squandering means which if properly applied
would have rendered efficient service to many at home who were the means
of saving us all as it were from misery if not destitution?. 11
Since he almost certainly had no money, the most important item of this
immigrant?s baggage was education. Was he a great-grandson of one of
England?s Enlightenment scholars, William Castieau, who composed the
mathematics section of the 1774 London publication of The Modern
Dictionary of Arts and Sciences ? 12 Whatever the case, his own education
prepared Castieau for a life in a colonial Victoria that was vitally engaged
with contemporary literature, journalism and popular theatre, as well as
giving him access to the all-important economic billet. Against the
background cultivation of his literary sensibility, he daily reflected on his own
and other?s fortunes, disappointments, sorrows and fates. Writing the diary
was a solace, and a means of personal reformation. In the diary Castieau
registered his failings and his progress in meeting the social and ethical
aspirations characteristic of his time.
He was scarcely alone in this pursuit in his era but this, we must remember,
was a man whose daily task was the imprisonment of others. Prisoners write
diaries, but how many prison governors? That is one reason for reading
Castieau?from him we learn much about the routines of punishment in the
everyday life of a prison in the colonial period. Another reason is the
extraordinary record the diaries provide of masculinity and domesticity in the
colonial era; Castieau?s reflections have attracted some attention in just such
a context. 13 A third reason is the insight his record of daily life gives into the
lineaments of the administrative state in the nineteenth century; what were

the conditions of life as a public servant in this age of the burgeoning state?
Castieau's persona is not a unified one ?the diaries are invaluable in enabling
us to approach an understanding of this person's many masks. Reading his
diaries suggests some need to qualify the kinds of differences between women's
and men's diary keeping, suggested by other historians. 14 Castieau certainly
chronicled a public' world, but the domestic minutiae of everyday life are also
captured in his relentless record. In the following pages I explore the ways in
which the diaries capture these aspects of a life in colonial Victoria.
DIARY OF A PRISON GOVERNOR
By the time Castieau was appointed to head Beechworth?s gaol in 1856
he had already spent some years in the colony?s infant penal system.
His initial appointment as a turnkey to the Melbourne Gaol on Christmas
Day 1852 was followed by his promotion to senior turnkey a week later
and an appointment as gaoler to the Eastern Gaol in 1854. His subsequent
promotion in March 1856 to the position of governor of the Beechworth
Gaol was to be the turning point of his life, enabling him to consolidate a
career in the prisons service, and to build a network of political and social
associations that served him well when he returned to Melbourne in 1869.
It was also the pathway from bachelorhood to marriage and domesticity.
He left Melbourne very much the single man but by the time he returned
to take up his position as governor of the metropolitan gaol, he brought
with him a wife and six children. His 12 years service there was eventually
to be rewarded with appointment as Inspector-General of Penal
Establishments in 1881, prior to being forced by ill-health and government
dissatisfaction to retire in 1884. 15
How did Castieau reflect on his career? What was his perception of
his role and responsibilities? The prison, like other major public institutions
of the nineteenth century, was regulated by a system of records that included
admission, discharge and punishment books, and a daily chronicle of events
and other matters of note. The records survive remarkably well in many
jurisdictions and in Victoria no less so. Castieau?s diary however is a private
record, its purpose being to monitor his own life, in its various dimensions.
His work is rarely forgotten but neither does it obscure the more important
issues of colonial life ?getting on, enjoying oneself, establishing and
maintaining a reputation, being a part of the world. The diary begins self-
consciously and purposefully, and in the aftermath of a fundamental event in
the making of Victoria:

Purchased this Diary for which I paid 10/- and considered reasonable,
it being but 50 per cent over the Home cost. Went to the Main Gaol
to hear tidings of the State Prisoners, charged with Treason in taking
up arms against the Government at Balaarat ...
There is a great deal of excitement in the Town, and the Gaol
Authorities fearing violence have barricaded and strengthened the
Entrance, as well as made a door as close to the Court as possible by
which to take the prisoners too and from Trial. I remarked that people
might break doors to get out, but that I hardly thought they would
break them to get into the prison. l 6
The solid stone walls of the later colonial gaols signified a material distinction
between the law-abiding and the criminal, but from his unique perspective
Castieau documented a constant movement into and out of the prison of
prisoners, visitors, officials, cabinet ministers, the media and, in less auspicious
times, of royal commissioners and other official investigators. Castieau?s work
as a prison governor can be seen above all as a position that oversees these
constant movements. A detailed account of this career would exceed the space
available here so I restrict my exposition of this process to a small number of
instances?to the management of communications with other agencies; to the
marshalling and management of press commentary; and to his role as a
guardian (sometimes a guardian angel) of the prisoners themselves.
The development of a career as a prison governor required careful
management of information about the prison?and about one?s career. Early
on, Castieau was conscious of the interaction;
Mr Wintle called this morning, previous I had received a letter from
him enclosing Returns to be made for the Blue Book. These returns
were for the whole year & I hastily imagined, an intention to impose
upon me other peoples work, so I indignantly sat down to write a letter
stating my inability to furnish the required information.
I sent the letter in and then of course as I always do, considered I
had acted hastily and that my refusal might be construed into laziness
or disinclination to give satisfaction. I shall never get on unless I think
before I act. 17
?Get on??the phrase summons up all the tactics disclosed by Castieau as he
seeks to place himself in the best position allowed by his circumstances.
?Getting on? demanded the cultivation of the right kind of connections, and
in this young city the press was vital to the making of reputations, of persons
and institutions.

Castieaus relations to journalism and the cultural life of the colony were
complex and will be discussed later, but in a city with such a lively literary and
journalistic culture it is not altogether surprising that his profile is almost
invisible in later histories. 18 Regardless of his cultural pretensions and
engagements, it was precisely in his role as a prison governor that he was
commonly obliged to nurture the press. His readiness to inform the public
about the colony?s penal system is evident from his early years in the Eastern
Gaol when he regularly provided the The Argus with information on the state
of the prison. By the 1870s, as one of the colony?s senior penal administrators,
he was in a position to shape public opinion more actively or else?as he saw
it?to challenge complacency and cant.
From the eighteenth century, crime and punishment were major themes in
the popular press, and in the journals ot the intellectual and governing
elites. 19 In colonial cities, the local press, indispensable translator of ideas
from ?Home? and cultivator of colonial idioms, kept matters of punishment
before the public eye. The apparatus of punishment was already visible
enough, whether in the form of gibbets on Pinchgut Island in Port Jackson,
in the public stocks in 1840s Melbourne, or in the visibility of the gaols
which, for much of the colonial period, were the largest public institutions in
a town or city. 20 The media fed on stories of punishment with alacrity, so that
no paper was complete without its formulaic accounts of amusements
from the police court, the horrors of Norfolk Island, and grizzly details
of a flogging.
For a senior prison administrator like Castieau, the attention of the media
presented both dangers and opportunities. The dangers were well in mind
when at the age of 26, early in his career as Governor of Beechworth Gaol,
he heard from Melbourne of the fatal attack by convicts on the Inspector-
General, John Price. 21 Castieaus diary comment reflected a common anxiety
of prisoners? keepers about the perceived double standards applying in the
press in relation to crime and punishment. Price?s murder was commonly
18 For example, in spite of Castieaus membership of both the Garrick and Yorick clubs, and his
frequent associations with leading figures in those clubs, he is unmentioned in such contributions
to the cultural history of the period as Harold Love, James Edward Neild: Victorian Virtuoso
(Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press, 1989) and Lurline Stuart, James Smith: The
Making of a Colonial Culture (Sydney, Allen and Unwin, 1989). His membership of the Yorick
Club is registered, however, in Paul De Serville, Pounds and Pedigrees: The Upper Class in
Victoria 1850?80 (South Melbourne; Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 381.

(and later) seen as the revenge of convicts on a brutal governor, whose
Norfolk Island reputation had stained him forever. Castieau wondered,
however, whether the press would always be so critical of violence in a man,
especially where it was exercised by a convict:
The officers of the Hulks naturally consider their lives in danger and
do their duty dispiritedly, feeling the irritating consciousness that if
ever in resisting personal violence they give a prisoner an unlucky tap
the wrath of the Press will be poured upon them and abominable
cruelties, the invention of men who know not truth, laid to their
charge. Should a poor ?Melville? brutally knock the Officer?s brains
out the persecution to which he has been subject will of course be
sufficient excuse. 22
Subsequently in his career, Castieau sought out the press to watch over his
own reputation and to protect that of his department. Clubland in
Melbourne, as in Beechworth, provided the opportunity to meet the
major players in the formation of colonial opinion. In Melbourne?s Yorick
Club or the Athenaeum, Castieau met numerous journalists on a daily basis.
To them he offered stories and incidents from prison life; from them he got
consideration and first call when a major prisons issue blew up.
In an official capacity, it was Castieau?s duty not only to provide information
to the press in response to their inquiries regarding crime and the condition of
prisons, but to ensure that the punishment of flogging would receive the proper
exemplary publicity. Castieau?s day would frequently be occupied with
attending the courts next to the gaol, where he would meet the press and pass
on stories about current business. Here he would invite reporters to floggings
when they were about to take place. How ready the journalists were to respond
was a matter of competing stories on the day. Hence in March 1872, a major
adultery suit involving a Melbourne doctor was enough to distract the reporters
from news of a flogging, as Castieau records:
There was a Flogging this afternoon but owing I suppose to the
superior attractions of Clarson V Blair there was not the usual crowd;
only one reporter put in an appearance ... Altogether there were only
three person besides the officials present & this I certainly think a
decided improvement upon the crowd that usually assembles to see
the flagellator do his degrading work. 23
Castieau may well have persuaded the government to restrict public access to
floggings, for only a couple of months later the Chief Secretary ordered that
22 Diary, 29 March 1857.

in future only gaol officials, the Chief Medical Officer and a single journalist
from each newspaper would be admitted to witness these displays of
punishment. 24 The importance of press reporting of such events was enhanced
by such a restriction, and Castieau?s role in gathering in the necessary witnesses
thereby enlarged. It was not a duty he embraced with any enthusiasm; his
distaste for the spectacle is evident in numerous comments in the diaries. 25
Castieau?s office as a public servant required him to draw a fine line
between public engagement and a more subtle shaping of public opinion.
During the hearings of the Victorian Penal Commission in 1870, for
example, he commonly discussed the direction of events with journalists and
others close to the commission, drawing their attention to the realities of life
in the gaols. But on occasion he was ready to go into print himself. On 3
February 1870, The Argus editorialised on the Melbourne ?roughs? who had
been fined �2O for an assault on police and demanded a ?system of penal
discipline? which would compel the ?Devil?s Regiment? to support themselves
through hard labour and plain diet in the colony?s prisons. Castieau was
incensed by the implications drawn from the paper?s favourable view of the
hard labour system at the Dunedin Gaol:
Interested myself this afternoon in writing a letter to The Argus in
reply to a Leading Article they published last week with regard to
Dunedin Gaol & the management thereof, showed it to Walford who
considered I had a right to send it to the The Argus without infringing
the Civil Service Regulations so after getting Polly?s approval of the
letter I forwarded it. 26
Thus fortified with approval from the Sheriff?s Office, and from his wife, Polly,
Castieau did not hold back. ?The luxurious living of the gaol inmates has become
a hackneyed theme for public writers,? he jibed, before detailing the meagre diet
of the Melbourne Gaol prisoners. Castieau?s years spent reading Victorian fiction
as well as the daily press enabled him to engage The Argus on equal terms. The
paper?s high opinion of the Governor of Dunedin Gaol was derided:
He is doubtless wise in his own generation, and has blown his own
trumpet most sonorously; but beyond that, I humbly submit, he is
most common-place. His report abounds in cribs and the stalest
truisms, one of which made me laugh at its depth. ?Prisoners?, he says,
?are an artful class?. Is not that a new idea? 27

Castieau?s letter was published and brought a visitor to the gaol;
In the afternoon the Sub Editor of The Argus, evidently the writer of
the article I answered, came to see me & I took him through the Gaol
& expressed my views on prison matters, pointed out to him the want
of employment for the women &c. 28
The result was a backhanded compliment, read with irony by Castieau.
In The Argus of this morning a Leading Article appeared in which ?my
taking an erroneous view of the meaning of a previous article? was
?readily excused? ?in consideration of my evident desire to improve the
system in vogue at the Establishment of which I was the Head?. I was
called ?Zealous & intelligent? & then (without acknowledgement) my
views as expressed to the sub-editor were put forth as the ?correct card?. 29
The cultivation of the press was thus part of the job, a priority indeed in a
service which was vulnerable to as many-pronged assaults as the prison
service. Prisons were always too abusive or too lenient; corporal punishment
always too harsh or too absent; criminals too often undeterred by the prison
or else too broken by the rigours of senseless incarceration. The nineteenth-
century institution was at one and the same time a sign of government?s
service to the people, and a source of potential embarrassment. Hence the
importance of one in Castieau?s position steering the right course through
these hazardous shoals.
There was also a personal investment in the cultivation of right relations
with the media, an investment which paid dividends in 1873 when Castieau
risked all in an embarrassing altercation with police and a prostitute. Friends
in the media and in high political places conspired to limit the damage, and
Castieau understandably dissembled to protect himself and his family. The
government?s notice was attracted when an anonymous letter to the Editor of
the Melbourne Morning Herald was forwarded by the Editor to the Chief
Secretary. It alleged that Castieau had been arrested for a breach of rhe peace
and subsequently fined 10/- in the Magistrate?s Court. ?Gaol Bird? asked: ?lf
this be so why should Bill Sykes be made very public with a big heading and
Mr Castieau?s escapade suppressed??
Subsequent enquiries by the government managed to contain the potential
damage, but Castieau was demoted in rank, a significant punishment for
somebody of his office and tight financial circumstances, and one also on the
verge of promotion. Castieau did not deny the substance of the case. He had
been arrested at 1.45 am at the corner of Bourke and Stephen Streets after an
altercation with a Constable Healy. Healy had noticed ?a respectable looking

man sitting on the door step of the Chemists Shop ... with a low prostitute?.
He had told the woman to go home but Castieau had intervened and
demanded that the constable bring the woman back. The constable refused and
Castieau threatened him: Til have you arrested in the morning you damn
fellow?, whereupon he was arrested. A crowd gathered and the Constable was
told that this was the Governor of Melbourne Gaol. After that, Castieau went
quietly to the watchhouse ?except that he called to the crowd and said ?Men of
England will you see me taken by a damn fellow like this?? Mr Castieau was in
fact in the state which is best described as violently drunk.? 30
Castieau?s account differed; he admitted an indiscretion, but not of a
serious nature. But constructing an account of himself as a sober and
respectable citizen he likely exceeded the bounds of credibility in the well-
knit male community of Melbourne society;
I spent the evening with some friends & must have taken more liquor
than I should, being unaccustomed to excess, I also smoked a cigar
which I have since been told was a very strong one & upon my going
into the air it had such an effect upon me that I hardly feel conscious
of what took place ... The constable probably saw a woman following
me with some evil intent & interfered, which interference I thought
uncalled for & led to an altercation which resulted in my going to the
Watch-house. 31
Castieau?s construction was disingenuous, at least in the context of his earlier
life. Years before, in Melbourne and then in Beechworth, there had been
other public incidents, a drunken brawl on Christmas Day 1855 leading to
him being escorted back to the Eastern Gaol by a constable; and then five
years later he broke the Post Office windows in Beechworth while in a
drunken stupor. 32 By the 1870s the threat of penury encouraged restraint ?
a middle-ranking civil servant with a family of eight was struggling to keep
up appearances. The arrest and fine in 1873, together with a demotion and
a subsequent lengthy period of rejected promotion applications (at least for
another five years, to 1878) were significant blows, and there is a sense after
this time of a determinedly sober and remorseful Castieau finally
surrendering to the demands of public life and domestic responsibility,
absenting himself from the Bohemian ways of the pubs and clubs of
Melbourne. Castieau?s cultivation of the press nevertheless had saved him on
this occasion from a worse fate?major public exposure and ridicule.

A decade later he was less fortunate. The Argus had been on the warpath for
some months in 1883, and the ?Vagabond? had been shown round Pentridge
and published a piece decrying its leniency and the alleged association of
young inmates with old lags. There was evidence that some of the agitation
was prompted by an informant within Pentridge, the warder Henry White,
whom Castieau knew was an occasional correspondent for The Argus. White
denied that he breached regulations, but maintained his writing, later
publishing his reminiscences, including his impressions of Castieau as kind-
hearted but ?of unsteady habits?. 33 Castieau and his senior officers refuted the
charges of maladministration but small cases mounted up to a larger
impression of incompetence. Within another year, Castieau was eased out of
office. His difficulties were compounded by the desire of a forceful premier
and Chief Secretary, Graham Berry, to place his own stamp on the
government of the colony?s institutions. 34
Had an appointment with Mr Berry this morning. He sent for me to
call at half past eleven & I was punctual. A Cabinet Meeting however
prevented his being able to keep the appointment & I did not see him
till the afternoon. He told me that I was to retire on compensation as
33 Public Record Office Victoria; VPRS 3991/P Box 1448, 83/Z10377.
34 The Chief Secretary had recently been involved in the dismissal of another senior public
servant. See The Argus, 6 August 1884 for the Central Board of Healths letter to Berry
objecting to his ?impulsive treatment of an old and valued public servant?, the head of the
board, who had been dismissed by Berry.


he believed was my wish. I replied that I had not said it was my wish
but that I was willing to do so if the Government wished. Mr Berry
had evidently fallen in with the wishes of intriguers & had listened &
believed one side of the question without taking any trouble to hear
the other. He said that Pentridge had been in a state of demoralisation
& that the change that had been made had prevented a catastrophe. I
emphatically denied there having been any demoralisation, but found
it was useless my attempting to argue with the Chief Secretary. 35
So, at the relatively young age of 53, Castieau ended his service. It was a bitter
blow, and preceded his death by only some months, for he had been in
physical decline for some time, and two decades of financial worries and the
burdens of work, not to speak of his earlier history of ?unsteady habits?, had
taken their toll. That story however was also one that belonged as much to
another trajectory?of Castieau?s passage from bachelorhood to pater familias.
The diaries of the prison governor speak to much of that life.
FROM BACHELOR TO DOMESTIC MAN
XXTThen Castieau essayed into the public sphere, he was inclined to seek
W approval from others first. One of the most important sources of
advice was his wife Polly, a constant presence in the diaries. Absent from the
early diaries, Polly arrives on the scene only at Beechworth, where they were
married in 1858. Sharing the gaol business during the 1860s as prison
matron, she is rarely absent from the everyday record of the diaries in the
subsequent decades, although not holding an office once they returned to
Melbourne. In the declining years she becomes ?Mrs Castieau or ?Mrs. C?,
with hints that her nervous illness and other debilities match Castieau?s
increasing hypochondria. This is a personal relationship of considerable
interest, as evidence to put with other accounts of the social history of
domesticity and gender relations in the colonial era. 36
In the earliest years, Castieau?s struggle with his demons dominates his
perception of the value of his life as a single man in a new land. His
dissipation in drink and occasional whoring in 1855 leaves him in a
profound melancholy.

The Money however is not the principal cause of my disliking to be

companions, I generally become merry, talk loud and laugh noisily. 1
must turn over a new leaf or expect to go to the Dogs, and be left
without a true friend.? 7
At the same time his plight during this year of loneliness is not without its
moments of reflective solitude occasionally relieved by achieving an ironic
distance from too self-pitying an account of his life:
I stayed at home the whole of the evening & trust that it is the
commencement of my doing so many nights.
Bye the Bye it rained very heavily and was extremely dirty under foot.
This might to a prejudiced mind be some explanation of my reformation
so I think it but right to my Diary to mention the circumstances.
I read aloud several pages of Martin Chuzzlewit & rather flattered
myself I gave expression to the authors nicest sentiments. I was extremely
pleased with myself & unanimously rewarded my exertions with a glass of
gin & water and the Hardest manilla I could find in my cigar case, after
which I tried on the smoking cap Emma gave me on my birthday, looked
in the glass & wondered I was not more distinguished then went to bed. 38
These moments however contrast with the despondency of continuing social
isolation as one lost in the numberless ranks of single men:
Went to the Theatre got drinking mixed liquors and felt very seedy.
Saw the Farce of Uncle John which was very well played. Came home
about 12 o clock, disgusted with myself, my associates, situation &
the world. I know I have much to be thankful for yet am far from
feeling contented, nay as I ought, grateful. Circumstance has
somehow throughout my life kept me a solitary individual. Confined
all day I gladly go out in the evening, but where am I to go to, no
families know me, no friends but single men no amusements but
theirs drinking & wenching. 39
This was a plight that he could only hope would be relieved by marriage. As
David Goodman has observed, citing Castieau?s case among others, the
ideology of domesticity was a powerful countervailing influence to the feared
37 Diary, 23 January 1855.

social disorder of the gold rush decade, and to the threatening isolation of the
single man. 40 Castieau is one who experiences the alternatives self-
consciously. His efforts to establish himself before and after marriage give us
a glimpse of the social mechanisms by which masculinity was managed in
nineteenth-century western societies. Central to this self-management,
suggests French historian Alain Corbin, was ?the strict management of waste?,
a balancing alternately of debauchery and then, overcome with remorse, of
the building up of personal resources again. 41 In the diaries, Castieau?s anxiety
to achieve a domestic resolution to his felt debauchery is especially evident.
Yet arranging a marriage outside the social contexts that might have
facilitated it at ?Home? was for him a seemingly mountainous obstacle.
The difficulties emerged during a largely imaginary courtship with a
prospective partner during 1855.
There is a young lady, a neat little body just my idea of a wife, sits very
near my pew, but unfortunately in such a position that I have to turn
round to look at her. We have exchanged glances for I really feel very
interested in her, but she is such a little coquette, that I can never make
out whether she thinks favorably or disdainfully of my attentions. I have
often thought of writing, but then Prudence whispers dont lay yourself
open without caution. I would speak to her but she is never alone &
worse still is generally met by some demon in trousers as soon as she
leaves the Church Doors. 42
A key issue in striking the right match was status, a fact brought home
bluntly to Castieau. Fearing his occupation would not serve him well, he
hesitated for some time before disclosing his feelings to the ?charmer? he saw
at church every Sunday. At one stage he contemplates speaking to the young
woman?s father but fears that his status as a gaoler will disadvantage him. 43
When, after about six months delay, he finally writes to Emily his worst
fears are confirmed in her prompt refusal by return note:
The Galling part of the note was, that my occupation was the
principal objection, so that the years I have spent in an arduous &
unthankful employment have but made me a kind of Pariah or
outcast, to the rest of the world, & yet I feel proudly that my position
is one that requires probity, intelligence & determination

& that I have in some degree displayed these characteristics since I
have been placed to control the poor wretches, that the law for the
safety of the commonwealth confines. 44
Melodramatically, he imagines himself as someone who would be uplifted by
someone like Emily:
I think mine is a most miserable & desponding disposition. I find in
myself such a proneness to feel wretched & miserable my face
frequently becomes overcast & bears as it were the index of deep
sorrow, while if I asked myself the question of my cause of grief, I
could affirm nothing beyond maudlin sensibility ... I love the Good,
the expression of a face is what delights me, ah Emily, you have treated
me perhaps as I deserved, but had you been kind you might yet have
had cause to be proud of your choice, love for you would have
ennobled my exertions. 45
On other occasions these platonic musings are contrasted with sensual
experiences with more accessible women:
Came to Melbourne and went to church in the evening, saw hearts
darling & felt more than ever in love. Should have tried to
communicate with her but that I was surrounded by so many
acquaintances on leaving the church.
Walked moodily down Collins Street & after walking past the house
twice was about going home when as luck would have it I met a
nymph of engaging appearance & who is acquainted with me. She
was very gracious & I to dispel thought walked towards her home,
when there she would insist on my going in & in I went & remained
for an hour or more.
Emily I did not forget you, less blame to me if I could have done so.
Came home at about eleven & went quietly to bed. 46
A few months later we discover that Emily is engaged to a storekeeper at
Ballarat. Castieau, this son of a British major, found the experience
demeaning, as he notes, perhaps especially so since the social ratings of
colonial society were not entirely predictable. His occupation seems to have
presented few obstacles to him establishing himself securely in the society of
?gentlemen? who made up the flourishing club life of Melbourne. As an early
member of Melbourne?s Garrick Club, Castieau records that one of the
meetings of this association refused to admit another applicant because he

xxii


had been ?a pastry cook & some of our aristocratic members were desirous
of drawing the line somewhere?. 47
In the end perhaps it was Castieau?s own struggle for self-esteem in the face
of the demeaning occupation of gaoler that cost him this first serious courtship:
Heard that Emily was engaged & at that moment walking with her
intended a Storekeeper at Bendigo. So there?s an end to my romance.
I am rightly served, my own bashfulness being the cause of my rival?s
success. What was the cause of this bashfulness, the dilemma I was in
as to how I should lodge a wife. I could support one decently, but my
mind revolts against the idea of bringing the woman I loved to a Gaol,
for I am so sensitive, that though it tells against myself, I do not think
I could love long one who would be satisfied to live in a prison,
though mistress of it. 48
In contrast with the self-conscious and lengthy passages spent recording this
failed courtship, Castieau?s eventual contraction of a marriage was more
economical. ?Thought of cutting my throat?and then of matrimony?
Goodman cites from a despondent Castieau in the aftermath of a boozy night
at the age of 23. 49 Castieau was never disposed to the first option and
eventually chose matrimony. On 30 December 1858, at the age of 28 and
now the Governor of Beechworth Gaol, Castieau married Mary Moore, four
years younger and known to him as Polly. She was a migrant too, born in
Whitehaven, Cumberland, one of the four daughters of James Moore, a
printer, and Jane Moore nee Ford. Perhaps she had preceded her family in its
migration?her mother arrived in the colony in 1860 with another
daughter. 50
The marriage was undertaken in haste and not widely advertised by Castieau:
Yesterday December 30th 1858, I took an important step in my life?s
journey, that step was getting married. I was attracted at the Church
of England Bazaar held about six weeks since by the many charms and
eminent business capabilities of Miss Moore. We kept a Lottery
together, & flirted to an extent that brought us into notoriety. Polly
got very much talked about & her name severely handled, however we
continued to be very much together & when the Bazaar was over, took

plenty of walks, had the usual sweets lovers indulge in &
innumerable quarrels. At length however we made up our minds to be
man & wife. This was on Sunday December 26th; that same night we
agreed to be married on the 30th.
I told Polly of my debts & how small were my means she did not
seem to care & so everything settled, we got married & rode away to
Everton without telling the Beechworth Folk anything about it. At
Everton we had a nice little place to ourselves & notwithstanding the
heat was great & the flies numerous & troublesome managed to
get on very well. Got home on Saturday. House much improved,
commenced at once a domestic life. Wrote to my sister, told her of my
wedding & sent to Neild for some cards for Mrs C. 51
The entry is awkward but the event was decisive for Castieau?s subsequent life
and his view of himself. Polly became the imagined conscience, chiding
Castieau for his failings even when she was far away. A year into the marriage,
with Polly gone to Melbourne to get some relief from the summer heat of
Beechworth, Castieau was back to his old ways:
Received a Telegram this morning from Polly, she had been quite well
during the journey as far as Longwood. I suffered all day from a
violent billious attack. Eat nothing and was repeatedly sick. Went
down to the street after eight oclock. Got into Denton?s Crofton asked
me to play cards and I foolishly consented. Played all night, I went
home at five o clock a loser of close upon �2O.
Poor Polly how sad you would be to know of my folly. 52
On her return Polly is faced by more of Castieau?s follies, one of which results
in him smashing the Post Office windows after a night of heavy drinking and
gambling. The angelic Polly again forgives him and Castieau?s remorse leads
to yet another resolution for personal reform, a determination arising not
only from the need to re-establish domestic harmony but also perhaps to
avoid future shame in the town:
I told Polly as much as I dared of my Evening?s occupation & then
firmly made a Resolution which if it pleases Heaven to give me strength
I will rigorously observe ?Not to drink Spirits except if ordered them by
a doctor or Gamble in any way whatever for twelve months?.
For more than a week I did not go down the street, I saw no one and
it was only on Sunday the 25th I heard the particulars of my conduct. 53

52 Diary, 16 January 1860.
53 Diary, no date but precedes entry for 26 March 1860.


Castieau refrains from recording the most intimate details of their life
together, but their closeness is evident; during her absence of less than a
month in Melbourne in 1860 Polly wrote at least 17 letters to Castieau back
in Beechworth, he replying in kind. 54 The diarist is not averse to self-scrutiny
in a way that suggests a consciousness of his own tendency to the pompous.
Back in Melbourne a decade later he records details of a steamy night in
January 1870, in the midst of a trying heat wave:
Had a little barney with Polly, owing to my reading some cutting remarks
by ?a woman? ?on women in the Broadway Magazine. I skipped all the hits
at the men & read all the slaps the women got. Polly found me out &
called me deceitful. The weather was so oppressive that it required a great
deal of forbearance to keep good tempered. 55
Predictably they squabble (?about nothing as usual,? he adds) but not for too
long, or at least not without Castieau wondering about his own predilection
for irritability and melancholy.
When Polly came back she was very jolly & wanted to be friendly.
I had however a fit of the blues & could be nothing but disagreeable.
1 did not go to bed for some time & when I did showed very bad
temper. I certainly am getting very queer & at times am inclined to
?give up?. I ought to be as jolly as most men, with a good billet & a
healthy wife & children; somehow or other what should be pleasant
turns out dust & ashes & all I long for as soon as it is got proves a
mistake & is soon considered valueless. ?I suppose it is liver.? 56
In this record there are recurrent moments of inter-personal discord that
speak of the negotiability of the Victorian home; two people weighed down
by the daily hum-drum, and seeking a way out without losing too much face.
The self-deprecating Castieau is not beyond seeing the humorous side.
This evening I had a great row with Polly. We quarrelled about Mrs
Smith. Polly takes her part altogether & I cannot do so. I said terrible
things to Polly & upset her altogether. When the time came for my
smoke I took my pipe into another room & did the sulky. Polly
would?ent make it up when we got to bed but wanted to get up & go
down stairs. I took the hint & instead of letting her do so went down
stairs myself where wrapping myself up in my overcoat I laid down on
the Sofa & was soon fast asleep. I had funny dreams & once woke
54 As recorded in the Diary, 14 January to 11 February 1860.

56 Diary, 28 June 1870.


up in the night & forgetting the room I was in groped about a great
deal until I remembered & found my way out of the room. 57
When it all seems to get too much?the endless debt above all?Victorian
manliness can be invoked to save one from the temptations to put an end to
duty to one?s family:
Then the time when a man?s affairs seem to himself hopeless and the
world a burden, then the devil puts into his head how easy it would
be to lie down & rest for ever. What shall it be, just a moment?s pain.
There?s your choice of poison pistol razor or river. Thank God
however that so many men though foolish enough to get into debt
and then mope over their troubles have still if regardless of?The Great
Unknown? been gifted with sufficient manliness to save them from the
sin of suicide for coward must he be who with wife or children or both
dependent upon him will desert his post reckless of the misery he will
occasion to those he leaves behind to fight the battle of life bear
the whips & scorns of time? the most of which their natural protector
could if he had done his duty saved them from. 58
In Castieau?s record of familial life then we see a particularly reflective account
of the way in which a Victorian male of the middle classes negotiated his path
towards respectability and domesticity. Yet this did not entail an abandonment
of the pleasures of society outside the home, especially in clubland.
CLUBMAN
As the capital of a fast-growing colony, Melbourne was the locus of a
lively array of cultural institutions and associations. Colonial towns shared
metropolitan enthusiasm for the advancement of knowledge and the sharing of
cultural interests. Castieau?s life, as we have observed earlier, was neatly divided
into work, domesticity and the play of clubland, the theatre and journalism.
The Melbourne clubs have been extensively documented by Paul
de Serville in his studies of the urban elite. 59 Castieau was active in a number of
them. His interest in the theatre was at the heart of his earliest engagement with
the Garrick Club, to which he acted as secretary. The Garrick was a meeting place
but also a vehicle for the production of theatrical events. Its most prominent
member was James Edward Neild, doctor, coroner and theatre critic whose
opinion determined the fate of many plays and operas in the city 60 .

His few months experience of the Garrick in Melbourne served Castieau
well at Beechworth. There he became a key figure in the activities of the
Athenaeum, a club that sought to make available to the locals the products of
Victorian literate culture. Membership of such clubs not only enhanced one?s
circle of associates, it reflected an ethic of service that explains the overlapping
roles of somebody like Castieau in many colonial institutions. His self-
perception as leader among other able men? was recalled in 1873 as he sought
to excuse his ?unfortunate slip? with the prostitute in May of that year:
To show the position I held, I was for a long time President of the
Beechworth Athenaeum, and connected with the Beechworth Hospital
from its erection, when 1 came away I had for two years been elected its
President. In the Country able men take part in the management of such
institutions, and the committee of the Beechworth Hospital was
composed of the pick of the neighbourhood. 01
The surviving diaries do not cover much of the period between Castieau?s
marriage to Polly and their return to Melbourne in 1869. In Beechworth however
other remnants of his work remain. An attempt to organise a Beechworth Garrick
Club may not have come to much, 62 but the establishment of a local Athenaeum
for cultural improvement provided firmer ground on which Castieau could make
his mark in local society.� He was elected to the Management Committee in
December 1859 and remained an influential figure there for the next decade. For
a number of years he served as vice-president to a busy George Kerferd, then in
the early stages of a political and legal career that would elevate him to the office
of Premier of Victoria in 1874 and a Supreme Court judge later. In 1864,
Castieau gained 27 votes against Kerferd?s nine in the ballot for President; the
contest was evidently friendly, for Kerferd remained a vital supporter of Castieau
in later years. 64
The committee was Beechworth?s link to metropolitan culture. Subscriptions
to newspapers and journals, the purchase of books and encyclopedias (the
Britannica was purchased in 1861, while Gould?s Australian Birds and Palgreve?s
Travels in Australia were purchased in 1866) as well as a ?stereoscopic frame? and
slides of landscapes, accompanied occasional poetry readings and dramatic
performances. The Athenaeum was an arbiter of taste, and of the advancement
of knowledge; in 1867 the subscription to the London Journal was cancelled
when the committee determined that it was ?of a lower tone than should be
encouraged in a literary Institution?. In 1868 Castieau moved that a large

collection of ?specimens of natural History, native weapons, minerals, fossils,
skulls &c? be purchased, a collection that survives to this day in the
Beechworth Museum. The importance of maintaining these ties to the
advancing civilisation of the colonies and Empire was emphasised in the
committee?s unanimous support for Castieau?s motion in 1865 that it was
?desirable to inaugurate a local exhibition for the Ovens and Murray District
in connection with the proposed Inter-Colonial Exhibition?. 65
The serious cultural business of the Athenaeum was something for which
Castieau felt some enthusiasm. But the social distinctions that came with the
cultivation of taste were not lost on him either. Anxiety over the kind of
people one associated with was inevitably part of the life of the clubs. Back
in Melbourne in the 1870s, as a member of both the Yorick Club, with its
bohemian pretensions, and the more sober Athenaeum reading room,
Castieau had cause by 1874 to ponder where best to spend his time:
This was another exceedingly hot day & particularly oppressive about
the Gaol. I worked pretty well all day & then did my Muster. I was
however very glad indeed to get from the place & to take even the hot
walk to the Club. There was very little indeed going on there. Three
inveterate cribbage players were hard at their game, Wheeler, Cox &
Harrison; besides these men there were Duerdin & Bright. I read for

the museum, Mrs Margaret Carlton, for assistance with the same.


a while & came away home. I do not think the Club is progressing
just now & it certainly is not getting more attractive. There is one
funny thing that I observe about it & that is its being studiously
avoided by any but hard up people; as a rule to be a ?Yorick? means to
be out at elbows. Some of the fellows that belong to the Club I like
very much but I begin to think that it would have been better for me
to have been contented with The Athenaeum & not to have been
tickled with the literary & scientific reputation of the Yorick for I fear
much in grasping at the shadow I have lost the substance. 66
Six months later he abandoned the Yorick and took up the Athenaeum, a
decision evidently prompted by Polly. 67 Yet after six months of almost daily
attendance at the Athenaeum, reading the papers, and borrowing its books,
he was drawn back to the Yorick, which moved its premises late in 1874,
diminishing its seedy reputation;
As we passed the Yorick Club some of the members saw me from the
window & beckoned to me to come to them. I went & was
demonstratively received by McKinley, Keeley, Harrison, Duerdin,
Short & others. The Club is now in much better premises than of
old and I was somewhat taken aback with the number of rooms & the
great accommodation. The place is not at all Bohemian in appearance
& possesses a billiard room & a drawing room. I have long had an
inclination to be again a member of The Yorick & to-night I was so
heartily welcomed that I could not withstand the temptation of
joining & so paid my subscription for the first half of 1875. 68
As this episode suggests, the conviviality of the clubs was quite as important
to Castieau?s use of them as the entree it gave him to a world of culture and
politics. The Beechworth Athenaeum may have eschewed ?Party Politics and
Religious Controversy ... as subjects on which lectures shall be delivered?, 69
but certainly there, and even more in the Melbourne clubs, there was little
doubting the importance of their environs to the cultivation of political
influence. It was in those places that one met the opinionated elite whose
scribbling filled the daily papers that were avidly consumed by Castieau and
his contemporaries. There one met Marcus Clarke, James Neild, James
Smith, David Blair, Jardine Smith, George Kerferd, John Joseph Shillinglaw,
and a host of other male friends and associates, all of whom find their place
repeatedly in Castieau?s record of his meetings and conversations in the 1850s
and 1870s.

THE DIARIES
As we have seen, the first of Castieau?s surviving diaries is the one he
purchased and began in January 1855. It is possible he had kept a diary
before this; in a quiet moment he later reflects on some writing that he had
undertaken while on board the emigrant boat that brought him with his
sisters to Victoria in 1852. There are however just 12 diary volumes in the
collection held by the National Library of Australia. The selection of the
diaries published here represents about 125 000 words of the 700 000 words
in the 12 volumes held by the Library.
The diaries were donated to the Library in two lots about 25 years ago.
Eleven of the volumes are small format volumes (?Lett?s Diary No. 8? for most
years and the Australian Rough Diary No. 6? in the last two years, 1883 and
1884). One volume is a foolscap size (Australian Rough Diary No. 4?,
costing 2s. 6d in 1877); this is the most carelessly kept of the diaries and
contains entries at random dates between 1877 and 1879. Apart from these
years, the remaining diaries contain the best part of a daily record for the
years 1855-1857, 1870-72, 1874 and 1883-84. Castieau kept the diary
intermittently between 1857 and 1861, but the volume for the last of these
years contains extensive notes that appear to be part of a preparation for a
lecture on the Crimean War, the kind of thing he would be doing during the
1860s as a leading figure in the Beechworth Athenaeum.
Were these the only years in which Castieau kept a diary? There is at least
one volume still in private hands?the one he says he purchased at the end
of 1874, and which does in fact cover about half the year of 1875 and extracts
from which form part of the exhibition at Old Melbourne Gaol. 70 It is
tempting to speculate that a diary might exist for the momentous year of
1880 in which Ned Kelly became the most famous inmate of Old Melbourne
Gaol. Yet the erratic record of the single foolscap volume that includes entries
from 1877-79 suggests Castieau had by that time wearied of the discipline
required by his previous practice of daily entries. The diary for 1883 has only
perfunctory entries, up to May, and in 1884 the diary was kept for just two
periods, 1-23 January and 11 August to 31 December. Castieau purchased
his final diary on the last day of 1884, together with some paper on which he
promised to commence his reminiscences. Perhaps it is this project that
explains the beginnings of an index of the contents of the 1855 diary, an
index in a different hand to the original and highlighting not only names but
events and observations such as ?R.C. respect for religion? and ?Superstition?.
Certainly the diaries for the years they were kept would have made a rich
sourcebook for the prospective author.
Apart from the potential of the Kelly period, the great absence in the diary
record is for the 1860s. These were the Beechworth years, during which

Castieau attained some eminence in local society and became the father of six
children (the seventh being born soon after the family?s return to Melbourne).
The birth of the first child, Harry, whose later years are so often featured in
the diaries of the 1870s, is recorded only briefly. Indeed Castieau ceases his
regular record of 1861 just a few days later and it seems more than likely that
family life and duties as well as the demands of work and social life and
institutions in Beechworth absorbed all the time of the once-conscientious
diary keeper. Whatever the reason, there does not appear to be any evidence
that Castieau maintained a diary during the remaining years in Beechworth.
The demands of editing the diaries into a single volume have required
significant cuts to the original text. 1 have aimed, however, at giving the
reader a sense of Castieau?s writing of the daily record as well as the narrative
of time that he captures. There is occasional evidence that Castieau kept
spaces in the original record of a day?s events in order to complete the
narrative of a particular event. An example is his account of a famous libel
case in which Marcus Clarke was involved, during the recording of which
Castieau notes ?1 shall leave space here to record the verdict of the Jury when
the trial is over?. 71 Respecting that sense of the constructed document I have
frequently preserved intact the records of whole days, sometimes a succession
of them, at the expense of being more comprehensive in the coverage of
material related to a particular theme.
As befits a historical document, language that would today be regarded as
offensive or racist has been retained as in the original. Castieau?s spelling and
capitalisation have also been transcribed as written but occasionally,
especially in very long passages, punctuation has been added or altered to
assist comprehension and improve readability. Ellipses have been added to
indicate missing text, either within a paragraph or between paragraphs but,
in keeping with National Library publishing style, have not been used to
show truncated entries.
This introduction has already identified what I see as some of the more
important thematic interests of Castieau?s record of his life, but it may be
useful, finally, to summarise the principles of selection in the editing. Indeed it
would be possible to produce an edition of the diaries that had as its organising
principles the themes that I argue are of particular importance. Possible, I
suggest, but only by violating the very significance of the diary as the almost
daily reflection that works through its immediacy. Nevertheless the themes that
I have imagined different kinds of readers might find engaging are the ones that
have helped select what is included in this volume. They include dimensions of
Victorian life that make up a significant part of the experience of what it meant
to be alive at that time. There is the public life of the towns and cities, vividly
created in Castieau?s daily record of what it was like to walk the streets of the
city at day and night, constantly encountering one?s associates, family and
71 Diary, 21 August 1874.


friends, calling into pubs or coffee shops or clubs, shopping daily in the markets
or the new shopping arcades of 1870s Melbourne. We see how one negotiated
loans and managed insurance as a means of sustaining a life beyond ones
immediate means. The diaries capture the importance of the churches in a
colonial culture that nevertheless is already flattening out religious experience.
As a passionate theatregoer, Castieau reflects the importance of the many
varieties of theatre in the colonial city?from Shakespeare through Italian opera
to Victorian melodrama and on to variety theatre, the circus and pantomime.
As already signalled, much interest attaches to the portrait of domestic life
captured in Castieau?s diary. The diarist is not so much attached to intimate
confession as to the detailed description of the incidents and dialogue of the
household, revealing not simply the daily routine but those of the seasons
and years. From Christmas Day and New Year?s Eve to Valentine?s Day and
the serial birthdays of a large family, the rituals of Victorian-era bourgeois life
included many of those important to the Castieau family. 72
Urban life is structured not alone by its entertainments but by its
institutions, where the dialogue of politics, religion, learning and
entertainment have their physical expression in the enduring architecture of
the era. This, I would stress, is as much the case in Beechworth as in
Melbourne. Though the scale is different, one has only to encounter the
historical landscape of Beechworth today to recognise the enterprise of the
mid-Victorians in replicating in thriving colonial towns (even a Village? as
Castieau describes Beechworth) the institutions of the cities, churches,
hotels, government offices, banks, clubs, theatres, libraries and museums. All
are institutions frequented by Castieau, his associates, and (depending on
gender and age) his family.
As a key figure in the colonial criminal justice system, Castieau?s daily
commentary on living the life of a gaol governor is of more than passing
interest. On the one hand we get vivid impressions of the mundane tensions
of prison life, its occasional violence, its bureaucratic routines, its life as a
focus of a prurient public, which accesses it principally through journalism.
On the other, the diaries show us the life of a civil servant, battling the
ceaseless torrent of central office circulars and other demands that bind the
officers in the ?red tape? that Castieau speaks of more than once. Here,
also,we see captured in the floodlight a middle-ranking civil servant who has
to shift constantly for his entitlements and advancement. The tension
between merit and patronage runs through Castieau?s perception of the way
Victorian bureaucracy works as he insists on his own superior qualifications
for advancement, but in turn presses his ex-Beechworth friend turned

politician, George Kerferd, for support in promotion. The passions of envy
and anger colour his responses to career disappointments but the diary
appears to be one means of keeping their destructive effects in harness.
Beyond their immediate representation of public and domestic life, of
performance and inner anxiety, the diaries we must remember, are also an
account of a transition from one country to another. As one of the settlers of
a land already largely dispossessed of its original owners, Castieau
seems barely conscious of the life of the frontier, and especially of any kind
of Aboriginal occupation, that preceded the establishment of both
Melbourne and Beechworth ?a frontier less than a generation old by the
time he arrived in Melbourne. 73 What he is conscious of is the making of a
new society, one very different from the old. Recording the procession of
2000 people at the opening of the Ovens Hospital in 1836, Castieau
observed the absence of ?careworn countenances?, ?No beggars, no silent
Hollow cheeked misery famishing but not outwardly complaining, was there
to meet the gaze. Thank God we have left all such in ?Merry England??. 74 The
rapid creation of a colonial self-consciousness in the post-goldrush period is
replicated in Castieau?s comments at such a moment. So, too, we may see
here the roots of a more assertive Australianness in the public careers of some
of his children, notably his namesake John Buckley, the second youngest,
who would write a prize winning essay on Australian literature for the
Australian Natives Association in 1897 and help Bernard O?Dowd found
Tocsin, the Victorian socialist journal of the turn of the century; and Godfrey
Cass (Castieau), a founding figure in the Australian film industry, who would
play Ned Kelly in some of Australia?s earliest films to build that legend. 75
The diaries that follow record not an extraordinary life, nor an ?ordinary?
one. The momentum that brings generations of one country to another lent
a particular significance to Castieau?s life. What he made of it is left in his
diaries for us to discover.
73 A rare reference to Aborigines is found in the entry for 1 January 1856 (below); the
denigratory comments on a theatrical performance of a corroboree in Beechworth summarise
a common colonial view.

75 John Buckley Castieau is described by Frank Bongiorno, historian of early Victorian Labor
and socialist politics as ?less talented and not as gentle? as the better-remembered O?Dowd,
and a ?wild fellow? in a discussion of the Tocsin group. These judgments lean on the witness
of Lionel Lindsay, who also attributes the themes of some of Norman Lindsay?s early
cartoons to the influence of ?Jack? Castieau. See Lionel Lindsay, Comedy of Life: An

CHAPTER 1: 1855?'FALSE PLEASURE'
The early months of 1855 were dominated in Melbourne by the state
trials of the Eureka rebels. These events attract Castieau?s notice and the
successive acquittals by sympathetic juries are recorded by him, not with
alarm but as a matter of interest. Yet the public life of the colony and indeed
the dramatic events in the Crimea (news of which was eagerly awaited when
each mail boat arrived at the port) were only backdrops to Castieau?s
preoccupations in this year.
The diary of 1855 sets a high standard to which Castieau would only
return in the 1870s. A record of about 70 000 words, it commences on the
day Castieau bought the diary (16 January) and continues almost
uninterrupted to the end of the year. In so far as a record of such regularity
develops themes, then we can identify in this first year of the diaries a
number of Castieau?s preoccupations. The first is his easy command of the
basic requirements of gaol administration. Though frequently irritated by the
demands of red tape now and into the future we see the ease with which
Castieau is able to complete a day?s work in a manner that leaves him free to
pursue his private interests. His work is competent but, as throughout his
career, his mind is so commonly on other things that his ambition to make a
name and career for himself is already being thwarted by the machinations of
his competitors in the prisons service. No matter for Castieau, however; he
has other interests.
The raucous male culture of Melbourne in the goldrush period is reflected
in Castieau?s regular consumption of its opportunities. There are in 1855
plenty of occasions when the diary-keeper records his feeling ?seedy? after
indulging too freely in the drinking and brothel visiting of his time. His
participation in these rituals of self-waste compete with his equally common
commitments to self-reform and intellectual and moral improvement.
Throughout this period his churchgoing remains constant, but even more
frequent is his attendance on the vital Melbourne theatre scene, leading late
in the year to his association with the establishment of the amateur dramatic
society of the Garrick Club.
As the brother of two sisters who had accompanied him to Melbourne,
Castieau was not isolated from familial routines, which form the
counterpoint to his own personal struggle with the demons of drink and
sexual debauchery. While he never reflects consciously on the significance of
his constant contact with Emma and Harriette, the diary captures the
importance of his regular visits to Emma and her husband Joe and his
elevation to status of uncle by the arrival of their newborn Agnes, in
June 1855.


This is the record, we have to remind ourselves, of a 24-year-old in charge
of one of the colony?s main penal establishments at a time of great political
ferment and spectacular economic growth. Castieau?s Melbourne in 1853 is
a place that offers the great opportunities afforded to settlers in a new land,
where institutions can be made anew from the materials furnished from the
old. As well, new personal challenges can be entertained by those who have
been dramatically displaced from their previous society.
January 16 Tuesday 1855
Purchased this Diary for which I paid 10/- and considered reasonable, it
being but 50 per cent over the Home cost.
Went to the Main Gaol to hear tidings of the State Prisoners, charged with
Treason in taking up arms against the Government at Balaarat. 76 The Judge
remanded them for 10 days, stating that being charged with High Treason,
they were entitled to that term of clear notice with copies of their indictments
from the opening of the Sessions. Mr Ireland the Counsel for the Defence,
stated he was prepared to proceed at once, but the Chief Justice preferred
granting the priviledge allowed by the Law.
This conduct seems evidently to betray an inclination on the part of the
Governt. to let the matter gradually drop, and in my opinion the men will
not be tried at all.
There is a great deal of excitement in the Town, and the Gaol Authorities
fearing violence have barricaded and strengthened the Entrance, as well as
made a door as close to the Court as possible by which to take the prisoners
too and from Trial. I remarked that people might break doors to get out, but
that I hardly thought they would break them to get into the prison.
The Visiting Magistrate inspected the Gaol today. I wrote a letter to my
sister at Geelong, enclosing one from our Father to her.
January 17 Wednesday 1855
Forwarded Letter to the Sheriff suggesting the propriety of getting William
Biggen into the Benevolent Asylum.
A very heavy fall of rain attended with thunder and lighting.
It is no wonder that the Good men of this town should earnestly strive to
conquer drunkenness when a moments reflection makes the mischief caused
by it so hideously palpable. Scarce a day passes but I have some poor wretch or
other brought me suffering from the ?Horrors? or Delirium Tremens. The
fancies of these men are sometimes Horrible, one to day (a wealthy Digger too
for the Police have deposited with me value of more than a �lOO Sterling)
believes the whole town to be in conspiracy to poison him, and in consequence
grew so frightened that he gave himself up to the Police for Protection.
76 The Eureka Stockade, an armed rebellion of goldminers in 1854, arose out of a number of
grievances including a 30/- tax on miners, lack of political representation, difficulties with
tenure and competition from the Chinese ( Macquarie Dictionary , 2nd edn, 1991).


I called this evening to see Lotherington, and heard from him that Emma
had been in town and caught in the rain had to stop 2 hours in the Arcade.
It makes me happy to notice how proud of and how kind too Joe is to Emma.
I met with Mr Herle, the Advertising Dentist of this town, at Black?s Concert
Room, and brought him home to smoke a cigar. He talks of teeth and pieces
of teeth, new pieces and mended pieces, much after the fashion a grocer
would discourse of so much tea and so many eggs.
January 21 Sunday 1855
Went to church this morning. Collection in aid of the Sunday Schools. Put
a half Crown in the plate, almost think I grudged it, yet have thrown away at
least a Couple of Pounds in trifles during the week. My only excuse is that
there is a Collection for something or other regularly every Sunday.
Catholic Prayers to the Prisoners by a Youth in training for the Priesthood
worthy of notice that the Roman Prisoners pay a great deal more attention to
their Pastors than any of the Protestant Denomination whether Presbyterian
Wesleyan or Episcopalian.
Called on Mr Read and prevailed on him to come and take tea with me.
After tea left him to go for a walk while I went to church. I have heard of
people being ashamed of not attending a Place of Worship, but I too might
feel ashamed of going, and in my mind slunk to my pew, as if to a place of
ill repute. I felt myself a hypocrite for I knew it was not religion brought me,
but desire to see and be seen.
Another Collection. Harrison held the plate & I put in a shilling. After
church Harrison and I met Interesting female from Arcade. Harrison
decidedly the favorite so I left them to their stroll. I am to be I fear fated to
solitude. I long for female Society, when out of my reach, and then cut it
when in my power to obtain.
January 23 Tuesday 1855
Went to the Promenade Concert in the Evening. Saw numbers I know but
am very dissatisfied with myself for being tempted there so often.
It costs a great deal of money, although the admission is but a shilling, for
Australian Politeness necessitates the asking of all speaking acquaintance to
Nobblerise, and as Drinks cost each a shilling a Pound soon evaporates.
The Money however is not the principal cause of my disliking to be there.
Tis the Publicity and the fear of being thought a fast fellow, for my
temperament makes me conspicuous, as when with two or three companions,
I generally become merry, talk loud and laugh noisily. I must turn over a new
leaf or expect to go to the Dogs, and be left without a true friend.
January 26 Friday 1855
Paid Cabman 10 shillings for Cab to Benevolent Asylum, made him a present
of a shilling to get a Nobbier, having caused him a great deal of unnecessary


trouble. Very unprofitable work for me these trifles. I have to pay them from
my pocket and then fight hard to get my own again. The Order of the
Government now is that for every demand Two Householders shall sign their
belief in its reasonableness. Extremely hot all day. Mr McNee called after
office hours and paid me �8.1.0, Eight Pounds One Shilling, on account of
John Martin at present under my charge.
Dined with Mr Black and knocked about till the Fancy Dress Ball
commenced. Comparatively few people present and these of the Genus Fast.
Drank with numbers but did not dance. It is no use being a hypocrite with
ones Diary, I cannot dance and every day find it more and more a drawback.
False Pride alone prevents me taking lessons. I would not learn when a boy
and now I have whiskers I am ashamed to be seen beginning.
John Edwards was dressed in character, or rather wore breeches, silk
stockings, flashed Doublet and hat bound with cherry ribbon, and auburn
wig with curls a la Cavalier.
Drink, smoke and chaffs, kept me till the musicians were tired. I got home
at four o clock A.M.
Improper persons will not be admitted to the Ball this Evening was an
announcement extensively circulated, & to carry out the sanitory measure, a
lynx eyed Detective was engaged to spot the naughty ones. Unfortunately he
had but one eye, so the frail fair doubtless got on his blind side, for not a
female was there in the room who was not notorious for selling her favors.
January 27 Saturday 1855
Rather seedy first thing this morning but contrived to attend to business. Mr
Wintle inspected the Gaol, chatted very friendly. I believe he thinks
I am very fast but yet cannot make out how the place is always correct.
Made up some newspapers for England & after four o clock, went out to
Post them. On the road to the office met Messrs McNee & Newby,
accompanied them of course to get a Nobbier. Went to Coleman?s, great
crowd there assembled to see a race for 75 Yards between a man and a horse.
All a humbug, and made up affair by the Publican.
Met Mr Haydn the Reporter of The Herald and our number thus increased
walked on to the Cricket Ground where the Band of the 40th Regiment
was playing.
On the way had a race with Newby, a pretty good match. I won.
I had Diarrhoea and thought it prudent to drink Brandy. Took a good deal
to much. Dined with Newby at Richmond, and then went into town. Pulled
up at Colemans by a Gaol acquaintance and set to work drinking. Went into
Gaol acquaintance?s house when Coleman shut up. I shouted a couple of
bottles of wine for which I threw down a soveriegn. Got very late and
eventually was left with the Reporter & McNee. Wanted to stop with a
woman that was in the house, she however was too mercenary, and though
at last willing to come to my terms, my inclination for her had fled. Got


home very late, but very thankful that I should be spared the mortification
of coming home disgusted & dirty the next daylight.
January 30 Tuesday 1855
My life is proceeding most unsatisfactory, each day more wearisome than the
preceding. Each day commenced with the lassitude caused by the last night?s
debauch, Each day fresh resolutions of reformation made, each day such
resolutions broken on the First temptation. I am not a Drunkard, I hate
Blackguard Society. I long for genial friendship, and to find one woman, that
I could love and respect. Wanting these, and also not having strength of mind
to study, nor a refuge in my own thoughts, after the days confinement I am
open to the calls of the First Idler, lounge about, Drink, look at the whores,
fool away my money at their homes, by paying for drink which is neither
wanted, nor drank, at prices four times as high as even the extravagant
charges obtained by Publicans & all for what, to be called a Good natured
fool; and upon reflection, to be disgusted with self & mankind.
Called upon Lotherington. 77 Emma Quite well. Invited to St Kilda but
refused, weather appearing unfavourable.
Mr Matyr called in the Evening. I went out with him and into several
disreputable Houses; Monk?s, Big Maria?s, Woman previously unknown but,
possessing Trap for Grog, Babies, Absent Lodger and absent husband of
mysterious pursuits.
February 22 Thursday 1855
The old man of whom I wrote yesterday expired during the night. I wrote
the necessary official letters and carried the one to the Sheriff myself to Mr
Wintle. 78 Found him in the Supreme Court extremely busy. The State Trials
having commenced, there were 180 Jurymen summoned in three panels of
60 each. I saw the prisoners put in the Dock. They are in general a respectable
looking body of men. One a Black man. The prisoners and the Crown each
challenged a considerable number of the Jurymen, and when they had at last
succeeded in getting a full Box, the Black man was put on his trial. The trial
at night not having nearly come to an end, the Jury were locked up in the
Supreme Court Hotel until the next morning.
The Inquest was held at half past eleven o clock. My old doctor gave
evidence and the verdict returned was Death caused by Delirium Tremens. In
the evening I met a neat little damsel in Black with whom I made an

Emma Castieau (1831-1928) at St Stephens Church of England, Richmond, 3 June 1854.
78 George Wintle (1808-1870), one of the earliest officials at Port Phillip, to where he was sent
as Superintendent of Convicts in 1838; later appointed as Sheriff and appointed Castieau to

Australian Nightingale to the scene of her achievements or more generally
known as Black?s Concert Room.
Met Mather and took a walk with him to Collingwood, had some oysters,
returned home smoked a cigar and tumbled into bed.
February 23 Friday 1855
Went to the Court in time to hear the verdict given in the case of the Black
man Joseph for High Treason.
?Not Guilty? said the Foreman of the Jury, and immediately arose a shout
of applause throughout the Court House. The Crown Solicitor Mr Gurner
was extremely savage, and shouted to the Police to arrest so and so, and such
a man whom he declared he saw assisting in the uproar.
Two men were immediately brought before the Judge who after a smart
reproof committed them both to Gaol for a week for Contempt of Court. This
is in my opinion a poor policy on the part of the Government as these men?s
punishment will be put down as spleen occasioned by the adverse verdict.
The Young lady did not keep her appointment.
Went to McEwen?s in the evening and then came home to bed.
Ordered a coat, trousers and two vests for which I shall have to pay �9.10/.
This is dear but if they are well made they will give double the satisfaction of
shop Clothing.
February 26 Monday 1855
Very busy all day, made out Returns for the past week and forwarded them to the
Sheriff. Dr Webster paid his usual visit. Went to the Supreme Court in the
evening, saw Manning another of the State Prisoners acquitted. The Attorney
General tried very hard for a verdict, and the Judge, though he summed up fairly,
summed up dead against the prisoner. The Juries will not convict men when they
know that the Sentence of Death would be passed even if not carried out.
Saw McNee and Newby walked with them a short distance.
Went to the Mechanics Reading Room 79 for a short time but could not
compose my mind to profit much by the Books or Papers.
Wandered about in a most ridiculous mawkish sentimental manner. Met a
woman of easy manners and went home with her, spent my money and came
home disgusted with myself and certain of rising in the morning miserable
and low spirited.
The Solitary life I lead seeing no one all day and having no one to converse
with or think of if I stay at home causes me to be about so much and to play
the fool so often. I make all manner of promises and resolutions in my mind
but fear to give them positive utterance, as experience alas tells me what wind
and vapour they in general are.
79 In Little Collins Street.


March 5 Monday 1855
Made out returns for the past week.
Visited by Mr Newby and a friend of his named Packham. They induced
me to promise to accompany them to the Theatre in the evening. It turned
out a wet night but taking an Umbrella we braved the shower.
The Play was Richard the Third. The House was densely crowded and
intensely hot. Mr G.V. Brooke 80 played Gloster and certainly is extremely
talented. The Melbourne Company was however painfully incompetent to
support him in so heavy a play.
The Farce of Kiss in the Dark made us all heartily laugh though the incident
is most meagre and absurd. I forgot my Umbrella and Newby has I am afraid
lost my stick. It is a rather dear amusement stirring away from home in this
town. A Pound is a trifle or at any rate is soon spent in trifles.
March 17 Saturday 1855
This was the last day of the Races, and I began early in the morning to feel
much inclined to go. At length after preparing for contingencies, I tossed a
Coin in the air declaring if it fell Head uppermost I would go if Tail I?d stay at
home. It came down head so away I went to the Bull and Mouth, jumped into
an omnibus that was about starting, and found myself on the course before the
first advertised race came off. Mr Sub Inspector Smith kindly passed me on to
the Grand Stand, where I of course got a good view, and although the horses
were not the fastest, yet the riders evidently rode to win, and consequently
made the matches somewhat exciting. Mr G.V. Brooke & Miss Cathcart with
some of the Town Company were quietly starring in a corner of the Stand. 1
bet a sovereign during the day, but fortune frowned and I had to pay it.
Coming home I met a girl who I saw once at Dr Stillman?s. I made an
appointment to go with her to the Concert Room in the evening. I met her at
eight o clock. To our disgust we met the doctor at the Concert. He had come
into town along with Newby, though very much against his ordinary custom.
Made the best of a bad job and eventually I saw the damsel part of the way
home, made another appointment. Felt very excited last evening, and chatted
away to several women till 1 believe the Doctor thought me a great rake.
However I got him and Newby to come hqme with me and take a nobbier or
two before they made way for Richmond.
March 18 Sunday 1855
Got up rather tired. Went to Church came home had dinner and attended
Catholic Prayers with the prisoners.
80 Gustavus Brooke (1818-1866), born in Dublin, was active on the London stage before a
seven-year career in Australia after his arrival in Melbourne on tour in February 1855
(Australian Dictionary of Biography).


/K/'t
Ayy A-A.
Mr Perrot called in the afternoon, stopped and took Tea.
I kept my appointment with Dr Stillman?s late Domestic and had a long walk
by the Banks of the Yarra. Extremely fond and anything but sentimental or
Platonic. I made another engagement but am almost afraid to keep it.
I left my fair enslaver in time to meet the good folk returning home from
St Pauls Church. Saw interesting damsel and walked with her till Harrison
joined us. We laughed a good deal and at length of her own free will she made
an arrangement to accompany Harrison to see me on Wednesday Evening
next. Whether or not to spy out the nakedness of the Land I know not. I
came home at length and after ruminating over a cigar and consuming a
nobbier, retired quietly to bed.
March 27 Tuesday 1855
Very little work to do to day. Went to the Supreme Court after four o clock.
The remainder of the State Prisoners were found ?Not Guilty? & Discharged.
A good deal of cheering took place
outside the Court House when
they were released.
The Old Court House has been
recently newly fitted up. A large
Cedar Canopy is placed above
the Judge?s chair, in the course of
the proceedings this ominously
cracked, and the Judge was obliged
to sacrifice for the time his dignity,
and ignominiously bolt.
The Papers who have laughed at
the Thunder being called into the
Summing up of the Judge on the
other evening when it was made to
represent a warning to the Jury, are
asking how his honor interprets the
giving way of the Cedar above his
head.
Went to Blacks and dined with
him, visited the Concert afterwards.
A young lady, rather ?beery?,
amused herself by accompanying
Madame Carandini but not at all to
the delight of the audience, who
raised a great clamour until the
offending fair one was forcibly
expelled.

at the Queens Theatre Royal.


April 9 Monday 1855
There has nothing of consequence occurred during the business hours of this
day, but since accident has again driven me into expense and made more
difficult my professed resolutions of reformation.
Going towards McEwen?s after Muster I ran against the Girl that
I accompanied home some days since. I had promised to make her a present,
or in other words to pay her the wages her class expects. To night I had but
a little silver in my pocket and consequently could not keep my promise.
I however accompanied her and some similar cattle to a house in King Street.
I paid there ten shillings for a bottle of wine and did not leave it until my
honor had contracted a debt of �5, ah and I?ll pay it too for to laugh at
Conscience. Pride will not allow me to run the chance of being pointed at as
a Defaulter.
Coming home 1 met Mather, that man unconscious himself under the garb
of seeming friendship has done me great mischief. He has money and his
business pays him to 'Knock about the town?. To give him his due he is most
liberal and spends pounds freely, but for his pounds I sacrifice crowns and
reputation. We went to Black?s, the admission cost me half a crown, but I felt
miserable and left early. I came home. At the Gate I met an unfortunate
whom I had discharged this morning, a recovered Lunatic. Without money,
friends or acquaintance he had learnt to consider even the cold welcome of a
Gaol a home. I know the town and could feel that he had wandered all day
& that he must be hungry cold and tired. I dispensed with the warrant that
Gaolers require and gave him food and a night?s lodgings.
Oh God help me, I have much to be thankful for and yet to-night
I thought how blessed would be to be thoughtless and inanimate.
I remembered I had loaded pistols and 1 thought of death. Lord help me or
I am undone.
May 4 Friday 1855
After four o clock I went and had a look at the new theatre now building in
Bourke Street.
Called upon McEwen heard a long tale of woes and troubles from him,
he cannot manage the women, the officers giving him more trouble than
the prisoners.
He walked as far as my house and we sat and smoked for some time
together. Walking back a part of the way with him we encountered a crowd
and on enquiring into the matter we found that some drunken fool had
dropped his Pocket Book, which was quietly picked up by some Knowing
customer who made free with its contents and then returned it to the owner.
Unfortunately for Genius two detectives saw the transaction and stopped
light fingers as he was walking contentedly away. Looked in at the Salle de


?The Salle de Valentino?
Reproduced from The Australasian Sketcher, 13 April 1876
Valentino. 81 The audience there is of a most villainous and Profligate character.
Dirty gents, Jew Boys, Grey headed reprobates, and repulsive prostitutes.
May 5 Saturday 1855
Did a great deal of business to day. First attended on the Colonial Surgeon
who held a long investigation on the cases of several men Remanded for
Medical Enquiry. Sent some men with certificates to the Police Office.
Attended on the Doctor wrote several business letters and afterwards carried
them to the Gaol. Talked with McNee he seems to be very uncomfortable
inspecting the affair of the money. I may do him injustice but I think he feels
he must have had the money, but yet has not the pluck or perhaps the means
to say so boldly, and so save an innocent person from sharing in the expense
of his mistake.
Gave the Reporter of The Argus my Returns for the Week. He happened to
be here while the Doctor was examining some lunatics and from his remarks,
I fear he may print something that will affront the magistrates. I hope not as
their worships may probably think his censures are of my instigation. Went
to see Joe, business has greatly improved at his Office, he paid me 25 T for
81 The Salle de Valentino, an entertainment venue at the corner of Bourke and Spring Street,
subject of a number of engravings by S.T. Gill.


some Cigars I got for him some little time since. Spent my evening at the
Concert Room & after it was over went home with one of the Miss
Swannells. Miss Swannell has a very nice voice, in fact is called ?The
Australian Nightingale? (but that?s Bosh); she sang us at home some very
pretty ditties.
May 27 Sunday 1855
After breakfast Newby & I went to church together. A Mr Roberts who has
been for some years a missionary among the North American Indians, and
who has come to Australia to tackle the Aborigines, preached an excellent
sermon. We had a collection for defraying the expenses of clergyman on the
Gold Fields, sending money to the Diggings seems or sounds very much like
forwarding coals to Newcastle however we were taught that if they would not
look out for their own souls it was our duty to look out for them.
Went to St Kilda. William Lotherington was in the same omnibus. Mr York
Senior was a guest at Joe?s when we arrived. Emma is better but still very weak.
I regret I took umbrage at some sarcastic remarks of Fdarriette?s 82 and at Joe
telling me not to talk so loud. I sulked all the afternoon, and for the first time
left Emma?s house with a cloud on my heart.
Went to church, it was a dirty wet night and I got home as fast as I could
when the service was concluded.
May 28 Monday 1855
Dr James McCrea called this morning. He was very friendly & drank a glass of
Sherry that he liked so much that I promised to get him a case of the same
wine. Mr Wintle came afterwards & I am also to get a case for him.
Messrs McNee & Newby came for me to join them to go and see the
funeral of Sir Robert Nickle. 83 It was a very pompous affair. The whole of the
Military Principal Government officers & Town Council were present. Two
field pieces were taken to the Cemetary and placed behind the grave. After
the service 13 shots were fired from them, a minute?s interval between each
shot, then the whole of the troops discharged their pieces three times. The
Affair made quite a holiday in the town, & folks seemed very jolly. 3
notorious prostitutes dressed in the most glaring finery with brazen
impudence, were seated in an open carriage drawn up at the side of the road
by which the procession marched. I should have liked to have seen them well
pelted with mud the shameless Jezabels.
Newby came home with me & I knocked him up a dinner. We then went
to Fox?s but he was from home, we however played a game of whist with Mrs
Fox & a friend of hers.
82 Harriette Buckley Castieau (1826-1886), his sister.
83 Sir Robert Nickle (1786-1855) arrived Australia 1853 as Commander-in-Chief of the
Military Forces. He administered martial law at Ballarat for two weeks after the Eureka
rebellion in December 1854 (Australian Dictionary of Biography) .


June 7 Thursday 1855
McEwen having told me yesterday that Mr Stoddart had borrowed money of
him, I began to think the Reverend Gentleman to be a little artful so to day
I forwarded him a sharp & short epistle desiring him to return the �lO he
had of mine at once.
Packham called in the course of the day and was afterwards joined by
Newby & Mr McNee.
Called upon Fox in the evening & walked with him to Collingwood to see
home a young lady who had been stopping at his home. When we got to her
residence I was surprised to find that the master of the house was a shipmate of
my own. He appeared very glad to see me & hospitably pressed some cider
upon us to which as it was rather sour Fox strongly objected. I with polite
humbug professed it was the best I had ever tasted. Mr Smith our entertainer
was a livery servant to a nobleman?s family in England, he saved upwards of a
�IOO and then emigrated to this country, unfortunately on the passage he was
robbed of all his money. It consisted entirely of soveriegns and he had
incautiously exposed his wealth on one or two occasions of which some
Chevalier De Industrie had taken advantage. The poor fellow cried like a child
at his loss but plucked up his spirits before he landed; when he did so manfully
set to work as a bricklayer?s laborer, saved money till he got a horse & dray and
has continued prosperous, possessing now a house of his own, three or four
drays & horses, and a pretty round sum in the Bank. Bravo energy &
perseverance, both however of little avail unless accompanied by economy.
Fox & I on our road home called in at the Brunswick Hotel & afterwards
to a not over respectable House in Stephen Street where we both spent a good
deal of money & I can answer for myself at any rate with very little
satisfaction, & that little not at all likely to be increased by reflection.
June 14 Thursday 1855
I stayed at home the whole of the evening & trust that it is the
commencement of my doing so many nights.
Bye the Bye it rained very heavily and was extremely dirty under foot.
This might to a prejudiced mind be some explanation of my reformation so
I think it but right to my Diary to mention the circumstances.
I read aloud several pages of Martin Chuzzlewit & rather flattered myself
I gave expression to the author?s nicest sentiments. I was extremely pleased
with myself & unanimously rewarded my exertions with a glass of gin &
water and the Hardest manilla I could find in my cigar case, after which I
tried on the smoking cap Emma gave me on my birthday, looked in the glass
& wondered I was not more distinguished then went to bed.
June 17 Sunday 1855
Did not get out of bed till nine o clock, had breakfast, settled one or two
disputes among the prisoners & went to Church. Read came in the same pew


and told me my sister had been taken ill, & that Joe was in town for the
doctor. As I had been expecting this intelligence & knew that the illness was
perfectly natural, I was rather pleased than otherwise.
Mr Rowe a shipmate of ours at present living in Geelong was at the same
church. We shook hands together but as he was engaged we had to separate
on leaving the Church.
There was a collection in aid of The Poor & Needy. A clergyman whose
name is unknown to me delivered the sermon which was short & impressive.
Saw Joe as I was going home, he told me that he had been sent to fetch the
Doctor & that he was already gone. Joe expected an addition to his family
during the course of the day. Under the circumstances I persuaded him that
he would be only in the way at home & that he had better stop with me.
Having himself read of the Cruelties of Nurses to husbands on such occasion
he coincided in my opinion. We took dinner at Gregory?s came to my place
& drank a bottle of wine, then walked to St Kilda, on the road meeting the
doctor who informed us that he had been sent for unnecessarily & that there
was nothing decisive at present.
This was a little bit of a Sell, however we made the best of it, got to St Kilda
& had a cup of tea. Harriette gave me for a birthday present two tablecloths
& a couple of very pretty bread cloths made by herself. Joe came into town
with me, he came for the purpose of taking a horse to St Kilda in case he
should have to come to Melbourne in the night. Mr Hearle called & went to
Church with me. I wrote a note for my pretty little girl, had the opportunity
but not the pluck to give it to her.
June 18 Monday 1855
The Glorious eighteenth of June is now made more memorable in our family.
For this day Emma was brought to bed of a little girl. Joe called with the
intelligence that I was made an uncle, & that both mother & child were
doing well.
June 24 Sunday 1855
Went to Church this morning & in the afternoon started for a walk with
Harrison & Read. Near the Punt at Richmond I fell in with Miss Cadden &
her little brothers & sisters. I abandoned my former companions and
accompanied my newly met friends.
Misses Cadden is about sixteen Years of Age, a native of the Colony. She
has a fine complexion, Very good features & a neat figure. Cadden is worth
too much money or I would try & win her for my ain little wife.
I walked to Cadden?s House & after a little chat came away with Mr
Cadden. We parted in town I going home & he to call on a friend.
Went to church in the evening. My watch stopped so that I made a
mistake in the time & got to church about half an hour after the service
had commenced.


Tried to slip a note into interesting young lady?s (last one) hand but she
either would not take it or did not understand what I meant by pushing
rudely against her. I rather think that I shall leave off going to St Pauls
Church 84 for the present at any rate.
July 12 Thursday 1855
Took my usual walk past ?Charmer?s? House. On the impulse of a moment
prompted by a sight of an Engraver?s shop I fancied I required Cards &
without more to do walked in & ordered a plate to be engraved and a
hundred to be struck off. They will cost me twenty four shillings or just four
times the Home Price, however vanity deserves to suffer.
Turned loose upon the world Mr Allen late surgeon of the Boomerang, he
having now recovered from a violent attack of Delirium Tremens. With
blasted reputation & empty pockets I fear alas he will but add another item
to swell the ?The Destitute of Collingwood?.
The Sheriff, the Inspector General & Visiting Justice paid the Gaol a visit.
They seemed very well satisfied.
The Visiting Justice sentenced a prisoner to four months labor in irons for
striking one of the Turnkeys. This was a secondary punishment for the
turnkey returned the blow with compound interest.
Called upon Joe, walked to the Omnibus with him, purchased a Bouquet,
saw Poole who asked me to go to The Patriotic Ball. I declined and quite
Huffed him. Went home, found my excursion the night previous had given
me a severe cold, & so went early to bed. ?I must learn to dance.?
July 14 Saturday 1855
Took a little stroll in the morning. Went to the Main Gaol & asked a
question respecting a prisoner?s money; could get no instructions, the Sheriff
not being at the office.
The Reporter of The Argus called upon me, and wished me to give
him some idea of the number of really destitute persons I had in Gaol on
an average.
I told him between 15 & 20 were generally confined who when their
sentences expired, were liberated but were without friends and unfit from age
or infirmity to get a living. These men endured privations for two or three
days and were then picked up by the Police & brought as it were Home
to Gaol.
Wrote out the Part I am to play with the Amateurs.
Amused myself with scribbling a good deal during the day, although we
were very busy metalling the Yards & as the men were continually going in
and out of the Gaol, I was obliged to be watchful.
84 St Paul's Church of England in Swanston Street, replaced in the 1880s by the cathedral.


Saw Joe off to St Kilda. Went to the New Theatre. 85 It will be opened on a
Monday and is the handsomest building I have ever seen out of London.
Mr Poole has taken two tickets for me in a good part of the house so Newby
& I are going together.
Supped at Gregory?s and then came home to bed, at about half past eleven.
August 6 Monday 1855
Mr Wintle & the Visiting Justice were here this morning. As we were
mustering the prisoners for the Visiting Magistrate?s inspection, one of them
a notorious vagrant of the name of Thomas Jones came forward and struck
me a blow. As may be supposed I immediately returned the compliment &
partly from my blow and partly from what was, I believe an intentional slip
my antagonist fell to the ground.
Dr Youl 86 immediately tried him for the Assault to which he pleaded guilty
& put forward as his only excuse that when previously he had asked me for
a pair of shoes I had told him to wear what he had got on. He was sentenced
to six months labor in Irons. If I did not know this customer so well I should
regret his receiving so heavy a punishment on my account, but he has since
I have been connected with the Gaols been a continual nuisance to the
authorities; on receiving his last sentence at the Police Court, he was told by
the Magistrate that he would be sent to break stones for three months. It is
very few stones I?ll break was his impudent rejoinder. Dr Webster visited the
Gaol & inspected the lunatics.
August 17 Friday 1855
Dr Webster called and examined several lunatics.
Ordinary business transacted during the day. Called upon Joe after four
o clock and was pleased to find that he & Emma had enjoyed themselves
much at the ball.
Saw William Lotherington and had a chat with Perrot.
Met Mr John Edwards and Dr Neil, 87 promised to meet them at William?s
at seven, to discuss matters concerning the Dramatic Club.
Met Poole and called on Gregory. Reached William?s at eight o clock,
talked a long time and eventually agreed to meet on Tuesday next at Mr
Henningham?s house.

Went to the Theatre, got drinking mixed liquors and felt very seedy.
Saw the Farce of Uncle John which was very well played. Came home about
12 o clock, disgusted with myself, my associates, situation & the world.
I know I have much to be thankful for yet am far from feeling contented, nay
as I ought, grateful. Circumstance has somehow throughout my life kept
me a solitary individual. Confined all day I gladly go out in the evening,
but where am I to go to, no families know me, no friends but single men no
amusements but theirs drinking & wenching.
August 20 Monday 1855
Had a considerable row with the old doctor this morning about the clothes
worn by the prisoners on their admission. It seems that there has lately been
much difficulty in finding their shirts for them to put on when leaving the
Gaol. I am perfectly aware that generally they have but mere rags and those
often filthy, yet as I tell the doctor if these were washed and labelled at once
there would be no difficulty. Now if a prisoner has an idea that there is any
doubt upon the matter he immediately boasts of having quite a new shirt &c
&c though probably his real garment was not worth plucking from a dunghill.
Dr Webster paid the Gaol an ordinary visit. Mr McColley Dr McCrea?s
Friend is quite recovered.
Mr McNee returned me Bleak House this morning, he borrowed a pound
before he left.
Went for a stroll after four o clock, called upon Gregory and took a cup of
tea, went on the stage with Mr Poole and shortly before the performance
took a place in the Stalls. The Play was The Corsican Brothers. Mr Black took
the part of the Shade of Louis.
Met Fox there and talked with him for some time. Left at the conclusion
of the first Piece and got home before twelve o clock.
August 23 Thursday 1855
The Deputy Sheriff, A member of the Legislative Council, The Secretary of
the Benevolent Asylum & Mr Wintle came to the Gaol this morning, and
inspected some old men that the Sheriff has applied to get admitted into the
Benevolent Asylum.
The Presbyterian minister read prayers and delivered an Address to the
Protestant prisoners.
Several acquaintances of Mr McColley called but he declined seeing them.
After Tea I took a stroll through the town and then went to Collingwood.
On my return I looked in at the Reading Room of the Mechanics [lnstitute],
amused myself by waiting a considerable time for the relinquishing of The
Argus by one or other of two very slow old gentlemen who each had a copy and
spite my impatience coolly kept turning over page after page as if they were not
only deeply interested in the news but also wrapped in every advertisement.


I got it at last, not however from either of them for they were as busy as
ever when I left, for all the world like two of Madame Tussaud?s clever Wax
Figures with a little internal machinery, that turned the paper over at certain
intervals; in watching them I had overlooked a third copy which I now got
hold of & then found ?there was nothing in it?.
August 28 Tuesday 1855
Mr Wintle called this morning as did also the Visiting Justice.
Made out my Returns for the past week and sent them to the Sheriff.
Mr Stoddart read prayers and delivered an address to the Protestant prisoners.
Went out with Newby and purchased a pair of trousers for which I paid
8/6. They will be very cheap if I can manage to wear them, of which I am
rather doubtful.
Returning home I came against a man of the name of North, he had been
previously with me on a charge of insanity. Shortly after his discharge a
Detective called on me for his description so that when I saw him yesterday
I considered it would be as well to take charge of him. I brought him home
with me & then went to the Detective office, found the man was suspected
of having murdered a woman at Alberton. An officer came back with me and
I gave North into his charge.
Went to the Railway Station and at Fox?s invitation took a trip by the train
to Sandridge, 88 where Mrs Fox and the children had previously gone.
Came back with them took tea & went with Fox to the Olympic Theatre,
saw the Play of the Courier of Lyons & the Farce of Poor Pillicuddy. Mr Wintle
was in one part of the Theatre, his head Turnkey Harris in another.
September 3 Monday 1855
Dr Webster called and examined several of the men.
Newby brought the pay. I paid the men. Florence returned �2. he had
borrowed and Hurlily �5.
Called upon Fox in the evening, and took tea with him & family,
eventually we proceeded together to the Theatre Royal, where the Opera of
the Daughter of the Regiment was performed very creditably.
Met Simcock of the Detective Police and accompanied him to the Salle de
Valentin?s. Knocked about till nearly twelve & then returned home to bed.
September 4 Tuesday 1855
Visited the Main Gaol. Picked out two men for this establishment, one to act
as my servant & the other to be constable in the Yard. Accompanied Rowley
to the Labor Yard saw a few amongst the men that had been previously of
my acquaintance.
88 The port of Melbourne in the 1870s, it boasted two long piers stretching to Hobsons Bay.
It was a frequent destination for weekend outings, and so used by Castieau and his family.


Mr Wintle was very chatty & agreeable. He accompanied me back to
my quarters.
Mr Stoddart called but did not address the prisoners.
The Visiting Justice made his usual weekly inspection.
To night we were to have the monthly meeting of the Garrick Club & were
to dine together at seven o dock. I called for Dr Neil and we went together
to [i.e. with] Williams [to] the place of meeting.
Mr R.H. Horne 89 and about a dozen members were present, we got a very
poor dinner and eventually found the attendance so bad that we threw down
the reckoning and adjourned to the Argus Hotel. There after a very animated
discussion a code of rules was passed and officers to manage the Society elected.
I proposed Mr Fox as a member, Mr. Akehurst The Argus Reporter seconded
my motion, and the Chairman acknowledged the result of the ballot by
declaring him elected.
September 9 Sunday 1855
Made necessary arrangements & then proceeded to Mr Cadden?s, found
the family ready for Church & accompanied them. Returned to dinner
after which Mr & Mrs Cadden, Miss Cadden & myself with a little girl and
the baby started in the chaise for the Lunatic Asylum.
After a little difficulty in finding the road & one or two good natured
disputes as to who should have the pleasure of taking ?baby? we arrived at
our destination.
Cadden & I introduced ourselves and Dr Bowie received us very
hospitably and showed our party great attention. We went all though the
establishment. The bedding, rooms &c look very clean but there is a most
disagreeable smell easily perceptible throughout the whole place. The men
are mostly quiet. There were however one or two sad exceptions, or rather
exceptions, for perhaps the Quiet miserable hopeless Patient is more an
object of pity than even the roaring madman, who if terrible and horrible
to a spectator, still can find in his wild imaginings food for mirth & though
mad as a march hare still in fancied dignity, as proud in his straight
waistcoat as the monarch on his throne.
Most of the men knew me & one poor fellow said he was detained for
my safety.
Poor Dahl was in a frightful condition. The Keepers told me it was
difficult to make him eat. He was in a straight waistcoat, was very filthy.
The poor fellow had bitten a hole through the canvas sleeve of the
waistcoat. Oh God preserve all from such a terrible fate. Handsome,
accomplished & Esteemed poor Dahl was once. Woman who caused the
change be happy if you can.
89 Richard Henry Home (1802-1884), English writer and poet, lived and wrote in Victoria,
1852-1869 ( Australian Dictionary of Biography).


The women were more violent than the men & were penned together
like wild beasts. 1 mean about a dozen of the worst cases. One had her
hands fastened behind and with demonic gestures jumped as close to us as
she could and from lips bloody & foaming spat at the nearest. Went to
church in the evening, returned home about ten.
September 13 Thursday 1855
Made out a return for Dr McCrea
of the number of lunatics & persons
remanded for Medical Enquiry,
who have passed through the Gaol
during the present year.
The number altogether amounted
to nearly one hundred & fifty, of
these at least one hundred were
occasioned by ?Drink?.
Wrote a long letter to Dr Bowie.
It was forwarded with three lunatics
whom I this day sent to the Asylum.
Dr McCrea called and completed
two certificates of Insanity that Dr
Webster had previously signed.
A great deal of curiosity was
prevalent in the town to day
concerning Lola Montes she being
announced to appear at the Theatre
this evening. 90 It is my creed that a

man of the world cannot aford to lose any novelty. I determined to be one of
the audience. Called upon Mr Reed and found himself, cousin & a friend all
Lola mad.
We took places in The Stalls for which we had to pay ten shillings each.
The House was soon crowded in every part. Lola Montes in Bavaria is the
designation of the Piece, which would be damned for all eternity as a
Dramatic production but for Lola, taking what she declares to be her own
part (in more senses than one).
I candidly confess my disgust at the affair, which to my mind is complete
with the rankest Charlatanism & the bare-faced impertinence of introducing
the Queen of Bavaria as an encourager of the Power of Lola over the weak
minded King is an insult to morality & common sense.
90 Lola Montez (1818-1861), Irish-bom 'dancer and courtesan': her already notorious career
on stage and in art and political circles preceded an Australian tour in 1855-1856
(Australian Dictionary of Biography).


Of course when the curtain fell there was a great cry for Lola. Some clap trap
Liberty speeches h la Mooney having made great impression on The Gods
she came forward & with a cat like smile through which the devil might
easily be seen, asked people not to hiss till she had finished. Then raving of
what she had done for liberty, and of what she had lost by her love of it, she
with a clap trap gag left the stage.
Met Mr Reed, he came home & had a glass of ale with me.
October 1 Monday 1855
Dr Youl and Mr Price visited the Gaol.
I went to the Main Gaol & got Mr Wintle to give me an old bed board of
which I made a couple of shelves for the Store.
Called upon Fox at the Railway Station & apologised to him for not
[keeping] my appointment yesterday.
Newby called with the Salaries for last month. I paid my men, stopping �1
[l] had advanced to Florence.
Called upon Mr Neild & went with him to the Queen?s Theatre opened
this evening with a new company on the low price system.
The Gallery was full of boys who made a great noise. The Theatre
altogether had the appearance of the Old Victoria in London. It smelt vilely
of Costermongers. 91 The performance was most despicable & rendered worse
by some almost obscene jests distributed at random.
Met Fox & John Edwards. The latter came home with me & I gave him
the letter I had for him from Neild. Got to bed about twelve o clock.
October 9 Tuesday 1855
Mr Wintle called & showed off a little by enquiring in the Yards if any of the
prisoners had complaints to make to him. I can afford to laugh however at
what I consider on his part harmless recreation.
Dr Webster called respecting Medical Returns. Employed myself during
the day in making out Returns which I afterwards forwarded to the Sheriff.
Called after four o clock upon Mr Reed, took tea with him & then went
to North Melbourne to see a sick friend. Mr Reed is become a member of the
Garrick Club and so in the evening we attended a meeting.
To my surprise the moment we entered the room it was proposed I should
take the Chair & the motion seemed unanimously carried. I thought it
would perhaps be better to say nothing so at once took my seat.
There was a great deal of unnecessary discussion & some little
unpleasantness in balloting for new members, the plan of excluding by three
Dissentient votes evidently working very badly as it gives a small clique the
power of mischievously exerting a personal animus.
91 Barrowmen.


One thing I must remember as most essential in a Chairman & that is
equability of temper. I apparently got on very well this evening, though upon
reflection I feel I ought to have done better.
October 10 Wednesday 1855
Dr Webster called & transacted ordinary business.
I went to the Main Gaol & chatted for a considerable time, during which
I sold Newby a ticket for Richard Young?s benefit.
Called upon Joe & got my umbrella which the girls had nicely mended. Saw
Mr Reed at his office & went with him to see his sick friend at North Melbourne.
Took tea with him on our return. Reed & his cousin are but little better
acquainted with dancing than myself & we all have long felt the bar to
progress it is to be unable to take share in the amusements of the Ball Room.
I am determined at once to begin & though it may look foolish shall take
lessons of Mr Denning forthwith.
Reed and I called at a Mr Lloyd?s dancing Rooms and found the professor to
be a very dirty little man, who at our entrance was smoking a short pipe. There
was nothing certainly of the poetry of motion in his appearance & yet he
appeared very confident of his powers. He had 45 pupils, whom he taught two
nights a week; on the other two he held a Ball, entrance to which was by a ticket
valued at 4 shillings. Mr Lloyd showed us with great complacency, a dusty little
room with a very questionable looking Sofa standing in it & which apparently
serves the purpose of Bedstead after the revellers have departed & Mr & Mrs
Lloyd are left to their domestic Bliss. The apartment however was introduced
to us as the ladies retiring room. Another Room exactly similar & separated
from it by a partition Mr Lloyd called the Gentlemen?s Lounge. The little
fellow apparently considered us dazzled & told us the class commenced
tomorrow evening & that we must pay in advance.
Went to a Bazaar at the Mechanics in the evening, spent upwards of a
pound & somehow or other happened to lose another from my pocket.
October 11 Thursday 1855
Took early walk as usual.
After I had got through the usual routine I called upon Mr Neild & we
agreed to go together & endeavour to dispose of some tickets for Young?s
benefit. We first called upon Dr Gilbee and Miss Gilbee. The lady agreed to
accompany Mr Neild & the doctor said he would attend if he could
comfortably dispose of a threatened midwifery case.
We then saw Mr Coates of the Bank of New South Wales & from him
learnt of an article in this morning?s Argus respecting the Garrick Club. In it
I perceived my name starring as Chairman.
From Coates we proceeded to Henningham & agreed to take part of a
private box he had engaged. He offered us seats & I hardly know as yet how
to get rid of the obligation without hurting his feelings.


Saw Young & some of his companions afterwards at the Theatre & did a
nobbier with them.
In the evening I called at Joe?s office and from thence, called upon the
Swannells and invited Louisa to accompany us, to which she consented.
Called for the lady and found myself comfortably seated about five minutes
after the rising of the curtain. Dr & Miss Gilbee shordy after made their
appearance with Neild and those with Messrs Henningham made up our party.
The house was crammed & Mr Young met with a very enthusiastic reception.
After the conclusion of the play the beneficiant being called before the audience
made a pretty little speech in which due mention was made of the Garrick Club.
Our party got on altogether extremely well & after the performance was
terminated Dr Gilbee invited us to his house, where we had some supper.
Neild & I then saw Miss Swannell home & separated. I got wandering
through the town, met a kind but well known damsel &C had a chat with her
before I returned to bed.
October 17 Wednesday 1855
Took early morning walk, saw the window where charmer sometimes peeps
from. Heigho it did ent do me much good.
Harriette came to town & I went with her to have her likeness by
Daguerreotype. She had to sit six times before the Artist as he styled himself
was contented. I am glad however to say that she brought away a very good
portrait & one that was considered second best came to my share.
Harriette dined with me & after four o clock I accompanied her to St
Kilda. Whilst there I practised the Polka with Emma and could get along
tolerably well.
Returned and took tea, then went for a stroll, saw Poole at the Theatre
Royal & waited while a portion of Hamlet was played.
Got home to bed at about a quarter to eleven.
One accustomed to the jealous protection afforded in the old country to
the liberty of the subject, would be much astonished at the simple causes that
here sometimes get men handcuffed as felons and locked up from a night, to
a month or two. A sneer at & exaggerated by a Policeman into hindrance in
the execution of his duty, may according to luck, be extenuated by a caution,
a fine of 20/- or 1 Month?s labor in Gaol. Old Colonists have no conception
of the disgrace a New Chum considers Imprisonment but look upon it
simply as a loss of time & opportunity.
October 22 Monday 1855
Transacted ordinary business, & then went to the Main Gaol, to endeavour to
procure two or three prisoners to act as wardsmen. Met Mr Neild & Mr Smith.
Mr Neild showed me a leader on the Garrick Club that appeared in The Age of
this morning. It made the Society look very important & as the Article
principally spoke of what might be was not exaggerated.


This was a very hot disagreeable day the dust being very annoying. The
evening was also very close, in fact so much so that many expected a thunder
storm. Catherine Hayes appeared for the first time in Melbourne in Opera.
The Theatre was I believe very crowded.
Miss Cathcart 92 or rather Mrs Heir who seceded some time since from Mr
Coppins company has returned to her allegiance & appeared last night with
Mr Brooke in The Hunchback.
I met Mr Reed and accompanied him for a walk after which we went into
a New Dancing Room called the Athanaeum, neither of us however took part
in the amusement of the place.
Got home about ten o clock. The lunatics were extremely troublesome.
Felt disgusted sat down & employed myself in writing such an article as I
would if I were connected with the Press & as well acquainted with the
subject as I am at present.
October 24 Wednesday 1855
Again very warm, spent the day in transacting ordinary business, received
Five prisoners from the Police Office.
Called upon Mr Fox in the evening & chatted for some time with him.
Came about a quarter to ten o clock and visited the Wards. Saw that one
man who had been received to day & who was suffering from a violent attack
of Delirium Tremens, appeared very ill, had him brought out in the fresh air,
and tried to rally him but without effect, for he Died in about ten minutes.
This poor fellow has left a wife and two children. He was a clerk and but
for drink would have been a highly respectable man. He was in Gaol some
twelve months since & was then attacked with Delirium Tremens. He was
very stout, & doubtless the heat had an effect upon him & prevented in the
diseased state of his lungs free respiration.
Sent for Dr Webster but quite uselessly as the man was dead before he
could arrive.
Went to bed, but could not sleep for the heat, had to get up to quell a noise
in one of the Wards. This hot weather makes it very difficult to manage lunatics
particularly where they are crowded together in the manner in which they are in
this place. Newby called. I went to Mr Bond & got the �l2 1 had lent him.
October 25 Thursday 1855
Busy in preparing for Inquest, wrote usual official letters, and despatched
them. The atmosphere relieved by a heavy rain attended with thunder.
Dr Milton brought an order to be present at Post Mortem examination of
William Anderson. It was performed by Mr Florence & himself. The lungs
92 Fanny Cathcart (1833-1880), prominent actress on the colonial stage, especially Melbourne
where she arrived in 1855 with G.V. Brookes dramatic company from England ( Australian
Dictionary of Biography).


were much congested & the heart was in a very flabby & unhealthy
condition. Dr Milton was delighted with the visible effects of intemperate
habits & will no doubt illustrate future temperance lectures by reference to
this case.
Inquest held at three o clock. Verdict: Deceased Died from Delirium Tremens.
November 14 Wednesday 1855
Went to the main Gaol with some ordinary business papers. Dr Youl called
at my Gaol while 1 was absent. Went to the Railway Station to see Fox,
arranged with him for rehearsal at the Station in the evening.
Received a lunatic from Sandhurst. Went with Neild to look over a
collection of old books that had been purchased by one of his friends. Bought
two volumes of Elegant Extracts, a French Dictionary, Bacons Essays & two
odd volumes for 7/6.
Attended Rehearsal in the evening made a great deal of noise, but read the
Play throughout. Got home about a quarter to eleven o clock.
Dr Webster paid ordinary visit to the Gaol. The lunatics have been very
troublesome during the day.
November 16 Friday 1855
Went as far as the Supreme Court & then to the Main Gaol, had however no
particular business. The Supreme Court was just opening when I arrived.
Dr Webster called during the day & examined several persons remanded
for medical enquiry.

Called upon Joe after four o clock and had a glass of ale with him. Received
notification of a Committee meeting of the Garrick Club & attended it in
the evening; was made chairman. Went to the dancing class but could not
remain in consequence of having to be at the Club.
Met Fox and walked with him to the Theatre Royal, paid half a crown and
went in the Pit to see a portion of The Bohemian Girl. Pit so crowded & hot, that
we were both glad to get out of it again after we had been a few minutes inside.
Had very little business to do to day and found the time pass very tediously.
Tried to write but could not summon an idea, to read, but could not keep
my eyes open. Tried gymnastics and exerted myself to touch my feet with my
hands without bending my knees; could not do it.
November 19 Monday 1855
Spent nearly the whole of this day at the Supreme Court Listening to the Trial
of Some Bushrangers. Condon Dixon & Jackson. They were found guilty of
robbery with violence & sentenced to be hanged. Condon made a very
effective speech after he was found guilty but neither he nor his mates seemed
to feel their awful position. One of the men, Dixon, is married and has a
family of children. They were all waiting about the Gaol and to a reflective
mind formed a very melancholy picture. The unconscious little children only
anxious to go home and knowing no other sorrow but hunger soon to be
made orphans by the law of man. Their future career perhaps embittered by
the taunts of the vulgar as to their fathers fate. Their mother alone in the
world left to her own resources and probably dependent for subsistence on
scraps thrown from the spoils obtained by the crimes of men who had been
her husband?s associates and who would not while they were out of Gaol,
allow the Moll of the Bloke who was scragged to starve.
Met Newby and went to Richmond, dined with him, had a game of cards
and came home, got to bed about half past ten o clock.
November 24 Saturday 1855
Mr McNee woke me about half past six this morning. He had come to town
early in consequence of the execution of three men being fixed for to day at
eight o clock, & as it is under the private Execution Act, 93 a clerk was
necessary to be in attendance with certificates &c.
Got to the Gaol about half past seven. The Deputy Sheriff & two or three
other officials were present, at eight o clock. Dixon one of the men to suffer,
was called from his cell, & pinioned by the hangman; after him, Jackson was
similarly treated & then Condon, the noted [last?] for hardihood of the three,
93 Some 13 years before public executions ended in England, the Australian colonies enacted
the abolition of public hangings, with an 1853 Bill in New South Wales becoming law in
January 1855, followed by Victoria and Tasmania later that year: John McGuire, 'Judicial
Violence and the "Civilizing Process": Race and Transition from Public to Private Executions
in Colonial Australia, Australian Historical Studies, vol. 29 no. 111, October 1998, pp. 187-209.


before the last was tied, he turned around and shook hands with the others
who then shook hands together. The horrible white cap was then placed
upon the poor wretchs heads and, with the minister in front reading the
Burial service the procession marched to the Scaffold. The men all walked
firmly & neither made any remark. In a few minutes the ropes were adjusted
round their necks the bolt drawn & their souls in eternity. May God have
mercy on them.
Made some more arrangements with regard to the Garrick Club, called
upon Joe after four o clock, attended Rehearsal at Fox?s in the evening, went
behind the Scenes of the Theatre Royal. Saw part of Box dr Cox. Got home
about twelve o clock.
November 30 Friday 1855
Hard at work all the past week in preparing for the Performance of the
Garrick Club & have somehow or other quite forgotten my Diary 94
Attended Rehearsal at the Theatre this morning & then called upon Fox,
came home had a cup of tea & went to the Theatre.
The Club met with decided success every thing went off well, all the
members played respectably and one or two took the house by surprise at the
talent they displayed.
The Governor and Lady Hotham seemed very pleased & laughed heartily
several times during the comedy.
After the entertainment had concluded most of the members who had
played took supper together, and after spending a pleasant hour or so I retired
& went home to bed.
December 1 Saturday 1855
Called upon Neild, then went to the Theatre to learn the money realised in
the house, found �B5 cash & �139 in tickets, had the tickets sent to the
Secretary and then after counting them saw them all destroyed.
Went with Edwards, had lunch, met Mather and went together to
The Criterion.
Came home about seven o clock, brought Edwards with me, had tea &
then attended a Committee Meeting of the Garrick Club.
A very stormy gathering, much discussion about a Jeu des prit [jeu d?espritP
published by Mr Horne in the name of the Garrick Club reflecting strongly
on Mr Coppin & slightly touching on Mr G.V. Brooke. 96
94 On 30 November the Garrick Club performed The Heir at Law (by George Colman, the
Younger) and other items; 30 years later Castieau still retained the white satin bill advertising
the performance (see Diary, 22 December 1884).
93 A witticism.
96 This was originally to be performed at the Garrick Club, but was published instead. Coppin
had already attempted to obstruct the success of the Garrick evening: Harold Love, James
EdwardNeild: Victorian Virtuoso (Carlton, Vic., 1989), p. 34.


Mr Coppin is the Manager of The Olympic and certainly appeared to use
every endeavour to prevent our first performance being successful, by
depriving us of an audience. He announced the Farce of The Garrick Fever,
had Mr Brooke?s benefit advertised for the same evening, and practised other
dodges perfectly well known in all probability to the profession, but with
which of course we were unacquainted.
Mr Horne then wrote what purported to be a Dialogue between Brooke &
Coppin in which they were represented scheming the downfall of the Club.
In it Brooke was made appear rather commendable than otherwise, though
his companion was certainly made utter most illiberal & selfish sentiments.
Both however professed strong indignation. Coppin wrote a letter to the
Press & announced Mr Brooke?s intention of speaking on the subject in the
evening when he meant to take his farewell of a Melbourne Audience. In the
evening, he denounced the poor Squib as being False and Malicious &
quoted Shakespere to prove the value of his reputation.
December 3 Monday 1855
Rose with the determination to proceed to work having wasted nearly all last
week in the business of the Garrick Club.
Put my office to rights & soon got everything in good order.
Dr Webster called and transacted ordinary business.
Went to the Main Gaol & talked for a short time to Messrs McNee &
Newby. Sent three lunatics to the Asylum. Received two prisoners, one
apparently very mad.
Went with Newby and called upon Mr Fox. I stopped and took tea with
him & then smoked a cigar till about eight o clock.
Came home, went through the Gaol, saw all was correct and then took a
stroll through the town, went into the Arcade & chatted with Miss
Hopwood, was chaffed a little about the Girl I love and am rejected by, kept
a smiling face & appeared unconscious.
Went to the Theatre saw a great many I knew, smoked a cigar, talked of the
Garrick Club, and came home about half past ten calling in at the Athaneum
Dancing Rooms on my way, or rather going a little out of my way to do so.
Hodges is Master of the Ceremonies, and appears to be thought considerably
?The Cheese?. Poor fellow.
December 25 Tuesday 1855
Rose early, had a row with Mather as I refused to go out with him. When he
called every person had disappointed him and I was sorry afterwards that I
did not conquer the disinclination I had and gone with him.
Mr Cadden and most of his children called about eleven o clock & I went
with them to Sandridge by the Railway & afterwards returned to their house
& took dinner. Mrs Cadden & Miss Cadden were ill in bed so there was not
much to give enjoyment beyond a very capital dinner.


Went to St Kilda in the afternoon and drove nearly all the way; of course
appeared very clumsy not knowing much about it. Improved however
coming back. While at St Kilda called upon Joe & Emma, and drank some
bottled beer. Drank a good deal of whisky at Cadden?s and felt very excited
when I left their house at about eleven o clock, not exactly drunk but reckless
and eager for mischief. Got into company with some excitable female,
attempted to repeat a kiss and got a piece bitten out of my lip for my trouble,
nothing daunted I travelled on, got into Spring Street, heard a merry party at
a house, rapped at the door, was told to walk in. Did so, found about a dozen
people at Supper, drew a chair to the table and joined the party. Every one
apparently thought I was somebody else?s friend and were very cordial. All
doubtless would have gone on well had I not unluckily attempted a recitation
and being too drunk to speak made a most complete failure. Then came
enquiries who I was, no one knew me and I was told to retire, but however
was too drunk to see the propriety of doing so. Got into the street, was
pitched into by two or three. Got my coat pulled of[f] my back, received a
black eye & a knock on the place where I was previously bitten & then had
to walk to the Watch Elouse with a Constable. However they would not take
any charge against me & I was allowed to walk home and home I went,
without hat, with only a piece of my coat, my face swollen, my shirt covered
with blood & my trousers in rags.
The Astonishment of the Turnkey on opening the door would if
successfully depicted have made a fortune for a painter.
December 26 Wednesday 1855
With head in agony, with conscience appalled & my whole face and manner
plainly speaking ?Drunk? I had to get from bed & discharge some prisoners.
How could I look officers in the face, how with my black eye & swollen lip,
speak with authority to men mostly punished for the crime that my
appearance showed I was myself guilty of committing. Oh Cursed Drink or
rather oh ?little mind? how I abhor thee.
To add to my uncomfortableness Mr Wintle called; however with under
the circumstances pardonable effrontery, I put a bold face on and appeared
as if but enjoying the good spirits (there is no intention of a pun) that should
be prevalent at Christmas time.
He took no notice. I went for a walk with him, but we parted as I saw Dr
Webster going towards my Gaol. Underwent Dr Webster?s puzzled look at
my ?merry? appearance.
In the evening went to the Royal to see the Christmas Pantomime which
proved a miserable & contemptible failure. Went from the Royal with Edwards
& Henningham to Coppin?s, saw there the party into whose house I had
intruded, had a little row first & then became good friends. Stayed out till four
o clock not because I was impenitent but that I might kill time & thought.


December 27 Thursday 1855
Went to the Main Gaol, idled there for an hour and then accompanied by
Newby went into town & had some lunch. My black eye an object of interest
to all my acquaintances & many strangers. Returned to Gaol in time to sign
a receipt for a prisoner who had just been brought in.
Hardly liked to muster but thought if I did not the men would view [?] the
matter worse than the reality, so mustered as usual.
Called upon Neild, then upon Joe & afterwards went to St Kilda, had
dinner & returned to Melbourne. Went to Coppins saw the Pantomime
which was very good & went home to bed.
I have felt very miserable all day. My position is a very lonely one & any
excess I fall into the error of committing is caused by my having none but
young men acquaintances, no pleasures but public amusements. The
ingratitude I feel I have shown in foolishly squandering means which if
properly applied would have rendered efficient service to many at home who
were the means of saving us all as it were from misery if not destitution. Ever
since my refusal the world has been to me a blank & anything a refuge that
prevented or delayed reflection.
December 29 Saturday 1855
This is the last Saturday of the year, a year that has in a great measure been
wasted by me, not even having gained fresh experience but rather doing what
previous knowledge had made me acquainted was false pleasure & pregnant
with future regret. I shall commence the new Year under difficulty. The
Turnkey in whom I placed the utmost reliance is about to leave & I shall have
to see that his successor performs, what this one always did whether he was
looked after or left to himself. With the blessing of God I will throw away all
foolish vanity & commence life as it were again afresh. If 1 get the
appointment of Ballaarat Gaol I shall be in an independent position & I must
sink or swim according to my exertions.


CHAPTER 2: 1856-61
'GOOD RESOLUTIONS'
The early part of 1856 was dominated by signs of physical breakdown
(with boils on his face and under the arm) of the kind that would
punctuate Castieau?s subsequent life. The symptoms were enough to drive
him to apply for a week?s leave. Then, quite unexpectedly, a new opportunity
arose. The diary-keeper who had repeatedly recorded his agitation in the
competition for a prison governor?s position up country was suddenly in
March offered the charge of Beechworth Gaol.
The change from Melbourne was dramatic. It is unlikely Castieau had ever
travelled much further out of the city than St Kilda before his transfer to the
new prison on the colony?s northern goldfields. As his 1855 diary shows,
Castieau was very much the urban man, enjoying to the full, and more than
was good for him, the conviviality of the city with its pleasure houses of all
kinds. In Beechworth, on the other hand, there was almost everything yet to
be built. Entries such as ?can?t find much to say? and ?spent the evening
looking at the fire? accompany other signs of the quiet life in what Castieau
describes at one point as ?a Village (what else is it?)?.
This very context however allowed someone of Castieau?s interests and
youthful energy to help shape a colonial culture. Beechworth was the centre of
a major gold-rush area and was barely three years old when Castieau arrived.
The establishment of a Young Men?s Association in May 1856 was the work of
moral improvers, in this case of Wesleyan persuasion, giving an ecumenical
flavour and then secular accents to an institution that became the Beechworth
Athenaeum in 1858. Castieau would be among its most ardent supporters, and
eventually a president. His own confession was Anglican and within a few
months he was on the Church of England Committee that would oversee the
building of Christ Church, in which he would in turn be married soon after it
opened in 1858.
Arriving in 1856, Castieau found that he was among those who helped
shape the institutions and feel of a rural town that in the late 1850s looked
set to become the major settlement of the north-east. The diaries show
frustration with Beechworth?s parochialism (probably accentuated in
November 1856 by his return to Melbourne on escort duty). Some resolution
to the personal isolation was found in his marriage to Polly in December
1858, though how far is unclear from the diaries, which fade away after this
date until his return to Melbourne in 1869. What remains from the
Beechworth years is primarily the record of a still-young man in one of the
most prominent positions in this thriving colonial town, who nevertheless
was in constant battle with his own felt inadequacy: ?I am getting lazier,


more careless, less zealous, less thoughtful, less considerate, less hopeful?.
Beechworth turned out however to be a place where Castieau found he could
give some shape to his ?good resolutions? of self-reform and his aspiration to
domestic harmony.
January 1 Tuesday 1856
Hurrah for 1836! A Happy Year to all! At five o clock this morning Hurlily
came to tell me that he had seen the Sheriff & that he had not allowed him
to withdraw his resignation. Denny seemed very loth to go and we parted
each with regret.
Had to do Turnkey?s work and my own as well & was hard pressed all day,
after four o clock went for a stroll with Ralph Henningham whom I met with
Neild. We called in at the Criterion and drank a couple of Sherry Cobblers
each. Henningham paid & I was sorry to have had two, when I found they
cost 18d each.
Henningham took tea with me & afterwards we went to the Queen?s
Theatre, nothing there remarkable excepting some grotesque antics made by
some Natives who had been trained to represent in public something after
the style of a Corrobirrie. Their so called singing & dancing was pitifully
devoid of anything approaching to Music or graceful motion & most of the
audience in consequence seemed little disposed to encourage Native Talent.
Came home at about half past ten & went to bed rather tired as I had had
a long day?s work.
January 3 Thursday 1856
Up at six o clock & worked hard as a Turnkey throughout the day. Mr Wintle
called in the morning & was very gracious.
McNee & Newby called upon me after four o clock. Harriette was here &
obligingly made me a piece of crape to put on my arm as mourning for the
late Governor. Attended half yearly Meeting of the Garrick Club, great
excitement in consequence of it?s being the time appointed for the election of
officers for the ensuing six months.
Was elected a member of the Committee and stood second on the list as
far as regarded the number of Votes given for each.
Got rather excited & went heavily into beer again. Neild & I fraternised.
Met Laurie of the Theatre Royal & had some supper, went home after
putting Neild through the window at his residence.
January 20 Sunday 1856
Went to Church this morning, after service went to St Kilda by the Omnibus.
Dined with Joe & my sisters, then took a walk on the Beach.
The tide was very low & there was consequently a dry beach beyond even
the so called ladies? Bathing Houses, notwithstanding there were however a


great many females bathing, some in gowns and more in nature?s apparel.
Their antics appeared to give great amusement to a crowd of lords of the creation
who were gathered at the waters edge, looking on, some probably affected with
weakness of vision for otherwise there was litde necessity, had telescopes, Opera
Glasses & other scientific accessories to sight. Ye Gods this is the Country
where models of the Greek Statue are reckoned obscene ?productions?.
Had Tea & then came to Melbourne. Attended church, after service walked
home with Emily?s sisters. Little Lotty is an engaging child & coquetted with
me very prettily.
Her elder sister was also very affable but Sweet Emily alas kept aloof,
walking some distance from us with the old lady her mother.
I do really love this girl, but fear there is no chance of my affection being
returned. I would make a bold push for conquest but that I think sometimes
it would be cruel to her, for I have no means to support a wife, no home
worthy of her.
January 28 Monday 1856
The day was very wet & cold & the atmosphere was in unison with my
spirits, for I felt miserable when I thought of the foolish manner in which I
now see I have played with my own happiness. I love Emily & shall be
unhappy now that I have lost all hope of her ever being mine, & have, to
increase my mortification, the disagreeable impression that if I had been
more the man in manner & less of the monkey in behaviour I might have
gained a Treasure without great difficulty.
Posted a Newspaper to Mr McEwen at Castlemaine.
Called upon Joe after four o clock.
Attended a meeting of the Colonists called together for the purpose of
discussing the Propriety of Petitioning the Home Government for the
Privilege of choosing our own Governor. 97
A large number of persons assembled but the majority evidently cared little
about the matter. The speakers could scarcely make themselves heard on
either side of the question & although an attempt was made to take the
opinion of the meeting the numbers seemed so equal that it was not till after
much difficulty & delay, the chairman was able to say he thought the
majority was in favour of the resolution & therefore wished the power of
electing their Chief.
Neild was with me the greater part of the evening & after we left the
meeting I accompanied him home. Mr Long invited us to his room where he
regaled us on Kidney Pies & Brandy & water. Mr Neild sang a flash song,
and exhibited one or two pretty pictures, & then I went home. Saw all was
right & got to bed about half past eleven o clock.
97 Castieau here refers to the (unsuccessful) republican agitation for an elected governor:

Vic.: Melbourne University Press, 1963), p. 211.


February 4 Monday 1856
Dr Webster called & examined lunatics. I went to the Main Gaol & held a
consultation regarding the Blue Book Returns. Transacted ordinary business
during the day & after four o clock strolled as far as Fox?s where I stopped &
had some iced sherry.
Returned home to tea & then amused myself for an hour with the second
volume of the Noctis Ambrosianae which I purchased to day. 98
Mr Reed called & I went for a short walk with him.
Called upon Neild & was soon after joined by Newby. We had made
arrangements for commencing the Study of French & this evening we took
our first lesson. Mr Lefarge is our Tutor. He is a Swiss by birth but evidently
considers La Belle France as his country. We had our class at my quarters &
made a tolerably fair beginning. Our master teaches upon somewhat the
same principals as Ollendhorf 99 & I think understands his work.
We had some sherry, but the old chap said it would do very well for John
Bull but recommended me strongly to get some Claret to discuss during our
French Exercises. My friends considered his proposal or rather his advice,
sound & I told him to order me some from his own wine-merchant. Went
to the Theatre Royal, took a stroll & came home to bed.
February 5 Tuesday 1856
Remarkably hot weather, overpowering to man & all animals but of the
Salamander Genus. Went to the Main Gaol & made arrangements to attend
the Governor?s Levee to be held to day.
Went with Newby but arrived too late to be presented to the Governor.
Left however our cards which were promised us should be delivered to the
Aid e Camp.
Lunched at Gregory?s Restaurant, then went to the Bank with Newby who
had the cheques for the payment of the Gaol Salaries. Received money due
to my Establt. and paid the officers.
Three dozen of Claret came ordered by our French Tutor. Newby called
after four o clock & we discussed a glass or two & considered it very good.
Called upon Joe & chatted for some time with him, read a letter which
Harriette had sent.
Attended Dancing Class at Denning?s. There were however very few ladies
which made the lesson a rather slow affair. Paid �2 for ensuing Quarter?s tuition.
At Ten o clock went to Hockin?s Hotel & saw some of the members of the
Garrick Club. They had elected Neild on the Committee in my place &
made a proposal to elect me Secretary in his.
98 The Nodes Ambrosianae were imaginary sketches on literature, criticism and politics of the
day originally published in Blackwood?s Magazine. Their character and impact are discussed
in Mark Parker, Literary Magazines and British Romanticism , Cambridge Studies in
Romanticism no. 45 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000).
99 H.G. Ollendorf devised a method of learning to read, write and speak a language in six
months that was popular in America as well as Europe.


Came home, smoked a cigar & went to bed.
Woke disturbed by a horrid dream or nightmare; by some forgotten train
of incident I imagined myself in company with Emily. I thought we had
some dispute & that some other person then joined us. Emily not only told
a deliberate lie but used language coarse & obscene. I cannot paint the horror
I experienced at seeing her I thought so good so pure so modest, suddenly
appear so coarse & base. I woke in a fright shaking in every limb, nor even
when I was consciously awake could I refrain from shuddering, or dare to
close my eyes again till I had breathed a prayer.
February 6 Wednesday 1856
Transacted ordinary business, in the afternoon Neild called upon me & we
went for a walk. In Swanston Street we met Smith & the three of us called
upon Fox at the Railway Station, who regaled us with iced sherry, most
acceptable from the overpowering heat of the weather.
As we were returning we passed the office of the Liverpool Insurance
Company & saw Mr Buzzard a friend of us all standing at the window, we
went in to speak with him & among other subjects conversed on Life
Insurance & ended by making a proposal or signing an application insuring
mine and Smith?s Lives for a �IOOO each.
This entails an expense of �2O a year & I really must now be careful or shall
not be able to keep all things square.
Called upon Mr & Mrs Poole & walked as far as Coppin?s Theatre
with them.
Had another French lesson in the evening. Mr Sorby [?] joined the class.
Fox called about ten o clock, & after the Tutor had departed Sorby, Fox,
Newby & myself sat down to a game at Whist. We drank a good deal of
Claret & eventually got very merry. Fox sang, & I recited. Finally my guests
took their departure & I got to bed about half past one o clock.
March 8 Saturday 1856
Verily we Know not what a day may bring forth. Went to the Gaol to learn
if any answer had been received to my application for Leave of Absence, saw
Mr Wintle who to my surprise told me that the Sheriff had taken no notice
of it, but that the Gaol at Beechworth was without a Gaoler & if I liked to
go there I might.
Mr Foster was sent to Beechworth as Gaoler some few days since, but
on arriving at the place refused to take charge in consequence of some
disagreement with the Deputy Sheriff. This Deputy Sheriff from all account
is a Tartar & worries the Gaoler with unnecessary interference. Said I would
return an answer by Monday Morning.
The Question naturally arises as to whether I shall better my position by
accepting this offer. Undoubtedly I shall be able with moderate prudence to


save money, a thing I find impossible with the connexions I have in town;
then on the other hand, I throw myself among strangers, lose the associates I
value, & have to encounter the petty tyrannies of probably a conceited
coxcomb. I should however lose my Cranky, miserable mob & have a real
charge. I?ll try it. Received a letter from Harriette. Met Mather who tried very
hard to persuade me not to go to Beechworth & gave the Deputy Sheriff a
very bad name. Visited Mr & Mrs Poole in the evening, went for a walk with
Mrs Poole. Came back to town, saw the Wizard Jacobs do a few tricks & then
came home & went to bed.
April 18 Friday 1856 [covering period from 13 March to this day]
Left Melbourne on this day [i.e. 13 March], at six o clock. Arrived at the
Beechworth Hotel on the 13th at about ten o clock.
Saw the Sheriff and got to business in a day or two.
Had one or two rows with the prisoners, but eventually succeeded in
getting them under tolerable subjection.
Found the Deputy Sheriff a very agreeable young man & willing to behave
very kindly to me.
Received much assistance from Nethercott whom I brought with me as
Senior Turnkey.
Delivered a letter of introduction to Dr Crawford who has received me
always with great kindness from that period.
Received my luggage on the 11 th of April found two or three of my
pictures had their glasses broken, but the rest of my traps in tolerable order
though evidently well shaken. My mattress & pillow had evidently from its
greasy state been used by the Drayman during the journey who doubtless
thanked Providence for sending him so good a bed.
I am now tolerably settled, begin to know my neighbours & shall be able
to travel on in the regular path, so pick up my Diary & intend to keep its
page regularly filled. Last night or rather this Friday night, I spent with Dr
Crawford, smoking & drinking. The rain was falling in a very angry
determined manner which made a social chat by a bright fire rather pleasant
to participate.
Prosecuted a man at the Police Court for endeavouring to hold
communication with prisoners, he was however discharged.
Went for a stroll with Inspector Wilson and did some hot beer with him at
the Eldorado Hotel which possesses a very agreeable landlady.
The weather is most miserably wet and cold and the wood from which the
houses in the camp are built throws a most uncomfortable dampness which is
uncomfortably perceptible in everything one touches or has to use. Articles of
clothing hung up in my bedroom get quite wet in the night.
Spent the evening chatting with the Deputy Sheriff. He is very affable and
we get on well together.


April 24 Thursday 1856
Wrote a long letter to Neild or rather the rough draft of one. Occupied
myself with business during the day.
Called upon Dr Crawford in the evening and afterwards went with
him & Inspector Hare to Captain Murray?s. Captain Murray is a most
aristocratic looking individual, very tall & wearing a long Black beard &
unapproachable moustache.
He received us in a very free & easy courteous manner & I soon found myself
quite at home. We sat drinking sherry & chatting till nearly ten o clock when
Crawford went home & I accompanied Hare to the Eldorado Hotel where there
were four [?] or five assembled. We sat talking over a solitary glass of grog till half
past eleven o clock & then I came home with Inspector Wilson.
All this company is very pleasant & agreeable & as yet I have met none but
sober fellows, jolly & good hearted enough but content to drink in moderation.
There is however a system on the Diggings of one person ?Shouting? for all
in the room & this becomes expensive to any person whose conscience will
not allow him to Sponge on any of the company, but who will return the
compliment if asked by any person to drink.
May 8 Thursday 1856
Somehow or other either thoughtlessness Carelessness, laziness or lack of
inclination has prevented me since I have been at Beechworth Keeping my
Diary with regularity. I am very sorry however that I have not done so, as the
trivial records of the present hour may probably at a future time be looked
upon with interest & perhaps become valuable as determining Dates required
& which without such refreshment to memory can not be recollected with
the precision necessary.
This was a very cold wet day & such a day on the Ovens District is
peculiarly unprepossessing. The Damp Cold that strikes a chill to the very
marrow and which unlike the brazing atmosphere of a clear frosty day defies
any amount of exertion to give warmth or exhiliration to the frame.
Nothing out of the ordinary course took place to-day excepting that I
schemed to & succeeded in obtaining boards to complete the flooring of the
Verandah to my house. I shall now have quite a Quarter Deck Promenade &
look to much enjoyment from the convenience on hot summer nights.
Passed the evening at home in studying French & went to bed at a little
after nine o?clock.
May 11 Sunday 1856
Received a letter from Neild, full of kind wishes & friendly gossip. Received also
from him the third part of Little Dorrit. m Called upon the Deputy Sheriff &
chatted for a short time. Went to Church.
100 Charles Dickens' Little Dorrit (1855-56) was originally published, like most of his work, in
serial parts.


Tom Long who has been sent to a market Gardiner or Dairy-man, or a
mixture of both to learn Farming dined with me. He complains of having to
work hard, being principally employed in clearing the Land for Cultivation.
I wish my frame had been inured to labor when I was his age. I should now
be much more independent & certainly should decline serving the
Government or as perhaps Dickens would say, being served by it.
Messrs Buller & Tyler, Clerks in the Resident Warden?s Office, called after
dinner when Tom & I joined them in a walk. We diverged from the Road
and took a Stroll through the Bush, came to a Creek & some rather romantic
though not very imposing Water-fall. Buller & I ran a race Up Hill & got
both awfully winded. The Exercise however made us all cheerful & we got
home in capital spirits.
Had Tea & then went to Dr Crawford?s, smoked a cigar or two & then
adjourned to the Eldorado Hotel where we passed a pleasant hour chatting
with Mrs Langford & in drinking hot brandy & water. Came home, went
round the Gaol & then to bed.
June 10 Tuesday 1856
My unfortunate Diary has again had another long spell but really there has
been very little occur in my monotonous life that would pay for reading even
if the trouble were taken to note it down.
I brought a poor devil before the Visiting Justice for Insubordination & got
him four days additional sentence. I am not anxious or even desirous to punish
those under my charge, but am occasionally compelled to do so in defence of
discipline & the preservation of something approaching decency & order.

Dr Crawford kindly lent me a horse & I accompanied him to see a patient
who lives some fifteen miles from Beechworth. We passed through the
Woolshed Diggings, the Centre of the mining population of the Ovens. I was
quite surprised to find so many flourishing townships. Large Hotels, Busy
looking Stores Bark Huts and extensive streets of Calico roofed buildings.
In one part of the Woolshed I observed a fruiterer?s store & its contents
which would have excited admiration even in Covent Garden, Monster
Melons & Gigantic pumpkins being however the principal stock.
When we arrived at the place of our destination the ?Kangaroo Inn?, the
Doctor operated on the Landlord & I assisted him as well as I could. We had
a glass of wine & then turned towards Melbourne.
The Doctor reminds me forcibly of Sir Roger De Coverly. He is a fine portly
fellow with a jovial face & a kind word for every body. He is universally
known on the Road & many a shout was made for him to stop; as it was we
both had to drink a good many nobblers in the course of our journey.
We called at The Camp & partook of the hospitality of Mr Warden Gaunt.
He is located in a Tent (which by the by experienced people make very
comfortable) and from it dispenses justice & settles disputes for miles around.
He has the character of a practical sensible man & gets on very well accordingly.
Got back to Beechworth shortly after Dark after enjoying my ride very
much, had some dinner, smoked a cigar & then feeling a little stiff from my
unusual exercise turned into bed.
June 15 Sunday 1856
Received a letter from Mr Neild.
Read the newspapers at Mr Brett?s House. 101
Went for a walk in the afternoon with Mr Tyer.
Spent the evening with Doctor Crawford. The Doctor has been a Naval
Surgeon & was stationed for some time at Monte Video. He amused me with
many anecdotes of the Service & his own particular adventures, amongst them
some hair breadth escapes from Spanish Bravos & Portuguese Foot-pads.
Came home a little after ten and went to bed.
Really man is never satisfied. When in Melbourne I was all anxiety to get
away into the country & now I am Up the Bush I find that towns after all
are not the least desirable places for young men to be in. If I spent money I
certainly had something for it, either Pastime or Society but here the income
is actually swallowed, for it takes very nearly all to supply bread & meat.
But for the lunatics I left behind, I should mope very much at my present
position, but when I think of being free from the responsibility of being in
charge of mad men I rally & console myself with the surety that man of a
roving temperament will always be anxious to get to [a] place and always
when there, desire to get away from it.
101 William Gore Brett, Deputy Sheriff and later Sheriff at Beechworth. He would become
Inspector-General of Penal Establishments in December 1884, replacing Castieau.


June 16 Monday 1856
Transacted ordinary business during the day, went for a stroll in the
afternoon to look for some men whom I had sent into the Bush to split
paling, could not however find where they were working not knowing which
road they took when they left the Gaol.
Good timber is now getting scarce in the immediate vicinity of
Beechworth, so much building & fencing being going on in all directions.
In the evening I called upon Mr Butler & met at his room Inspector
Mason, Mr Walden, Clerk of the Peace & Mr Brett the Deputy Sheriff.
Walden & I played several games at Ecarte.
Butler came over with me & had a glass of grog after which I turned
into bed.
The weather is exceedingly cold & cheerless, & except when actively
employed I feel very dull. Walden & I talk of studying French & I hope we
shall carry out the idea. I can not study by myself but I think with a
companion, or with an incentive to emulation, I should get on & study [&]
once [it] became a habit would be undoubtedly a pleasure & help to chase
ennui away more than any amusement, particularly those which occasionally
in the morning produce lank pockets & Burning Heads to aid the stings of
conscience or reflection.
June 17 Tuesday 1856
We had a tolerably fine day, something to be pleased at after a previous
fortnight rendered miserable by almost continuous rain which besides the
disadvantages of wet jackets & smoky chimneys rendered the streets almost
impassable & in fact only allowed pedestrianism at the expense of muddy
boots & muddy trousers.
I do not exactly understand why but accustomed as I have been lately
to bad roads I cannot step into a soft place without a shudder & almost
a curse. 102
Made out Returns & took them to the Deputy Sheriff.
Very dull & lazy during the evening, did nothing but yawn away the time
& try to think. Not an idea however crossed my imagination & so I sat till
my mind was softened & revelled in that last refuge of idleness, ?Building
Castles in the Air?. If I only had so many hundred weight of Gold.
1 was to pick it up I suppose, for I never once conceived working for it; how
I would astonish every one at home, how comfortable I would make my
sisters. I was supposing I had a �lOO,OOO and contemplating at the moment
whether �3OOO a piece would not be too much for me to spare them as their
share of my prosperity. I went on picturing for my senses every gratification
they could glory in till the Bubble broke & I found I had one evening more
to lament in the future having thrown away.
102 Castieau has scrawled what appears to read 'Bosh. JBC' across this section.


June 27 Friday 1856
Boast not of to morrow. I have been of late too puffed up with the idea of my
own cleverness & efficiency for the Post which I occupy. This morning my
pride got rather a severe blow. The morning was very dark & when the Senior
Turnkey came to me for the keys it was indolence alone that prevented me
from telling him not to let the men out of their cells. I was in the Yard at
quarter to eight o clock & everything seemed all correct but when the Bell
rang for breakfast & the men were mustered one of them was missing. No
one saw him go & no one knew when he went excepting that it must have
been between seven & eight o clock.
Of course I gave information immediately to the Police & equally of course
it has as yet done no good. One Constable was sent by his superior officer to
report the escape at the Woolshed about five miles from Beechworth. When
he arrived there he was asked for the man?s description, could not however
tell. Knew nothing about it except that ?Ginger? had got away. Nothing but
luck will of course enable such men as these to do any good.
I am very much annoyed. I had flattered myself that 1 had made the little
establishment 1 am in charge of almost a model country one. All my Castles in
the Air are however now burst & 1 stand as the responsible cause of one
June 28 Saturday 1856 [i.e. Friday contd]
of the biggest blackguards in the Colony being free again to riot upon the
community.
My plans were still I believe as good as the miserable construction of the
Gaol would allow but then I may perhaps say without vanity they require
constantly my own eye to keep them in order & regularity.
Mistaken Zeal on the part of the Senior Turnkey caused the accident.
Knowing my wish to get work done by the sentenced men he allowed them to
leave their cells on a morning when judgment should have told him was unfit
for their being trusted in so insecure a Stockade as he had to keep them in.
The Deputy Sheriff enquired into the matter & I could easily have thrown
the blame from off my own shoulders. I scorned however any such meanness
& held myself responsible. What is the most annoying circumstance is that
1 have to accept the advice & cautions of persons entirely ignorant of Gaols
and prisoners & have to be told by them that I should have done so & so or
that 1 was very rash to do such a thing.
In the evening I romantically set out in the hope of making a re-capture.
I got over the Creek & the One Mile. The night was Dark the Roads
inexpressibly dirty & I had no knowledge of the neighbourhood. In
imminent danger of being smothered in one of the many holes that were
June 29 Sunday 1856 [i.e. Friday contd]
around me I wandered for some time mid-leg in mud & then seeing the folly
of my attempt endeavoured to get back to my quarters. I missed the track &


was rather afraid of being bushed until the owner of a Tent somewhat more
civil & charitable than the generality of Diggers got from his couch & with
his hand pointed the way to Beechworth.
I got home about eleven o clock in rather a pickle, thankful however to
God that I got home at all.
SATURDAY. Wrote a letter to Joe complaining of my bad luck, but however was
obliged before I finished to turn the subject somewhat into ridicule for fear that
Dear Emma might fancy things were going worse with me than the reality.
I do not get on well at Beechworth. I am too independent for my place
& the petty magnates of the Village (what else is it?) 103 look upon my
proceedings with suspicion. I have endeavoured strictly to carry out my duty
& have offended grievously the Superintendent of Police because I have
prevented him employing prisoners when & how he pleased. Dont let any
Officer imagine he is likely to benefit himself by leaving Town for Country
Quarters; he is quite out of the Road for promotion, has to get his orders &
instructions second hand instead of receiving them from the Head of the
Department, has to wait longer for his pay, is entirely without female society
& at greater expense for necessaries than in any other part of the world.
July 3 Thursday 1856
Attended a meeting held in the township for the purpose of petitioning the
Legislature to proclaim Beechworth a Municipality.
Considerable gas was evaporated & Mr Mooney of Melbourne notoriety
and who appears to be considered somewhat of an oracle on the Ovens
delivered a rather pompous Harrangue on the advantages which in his travels
through the world he had seen developed by municipal institutions.
He considered (of course) that Beechworth would eventually become a Great
City. From its geographical position it appeared to him likely to be one of the
Greatest & most prosperous of the cities springing up in this rising empire. With
a few utopian ideas of feeding the digger with flour at five pounds a ton Mr
Mooney gracefully concluded & after a little senseless chat the meeting agreed
to certain boundaries for the Township & then one gentleman proposed that the
gentlemen who had been accommodated with chairs during the evening should
shout for those who had been obliged to stand which however though carried
unanimously was not acted on, for the meeting at once dissolved & took
nobblers according to fancy or friendship at the Bar of the Hotel.
July 5 Saturday 1856
Had a little unpleasantness although not an open rupture with the Deputy
Sheriff. There evidently requires a line of distinction to be drawn between his
103 The population of the township in 1837 was over 3000. See Carole Woods, Beechworth: A
Titan's Field (Beechworth, Vic., 1985) p. 73.


duties & mine, where his responsibility commences & where mine ends. At
present all the real responsibility is mine while he ogre like sits in his office
& takes the credit & with Duffy like letters to the Sheriff swallows up my
individuality with his own I. I. I.
Wrote a letter to Mather & also one to my sister.
Weather is very wet & miserable. I have little or no society & sit at home by
myself evening after evening. I try to study French but have not yet been able to
bring my mind thoroughly to the work. I find however that it requires work &
that little is done by yawning over Ollendhorf or the Grammar for half an hour. 104
Mine seems doomed to be a life of solitude. Even at school I was alone &
alas from that cause attribute most of the bad traits of my character &
disposition. After school, thrown again alone into lodgings at Portsmouth &
after that again alone in London & now alone in Australia
Well after all mine though a chequered [one] has been a fortunate existence
for there have been many times when nothing but the goodness of God has
saved me from being plunged into wretchedness.
July 12 Saturday 1856
Brought the prisoner who escaped & was retaken before the Magistrate &
Committed him for Trial for the Escape. Rather a cowardly proceeding
I am afraid as I really think better of a man who plucks up his energies and
takes an opportunity if opened to him of getting away from bondage.
This Gaol is however so extremely insecure that every advantage must be
laid hold of that will at all help to keep the prisoners & punishing this man
for the Escape will I hope render future attempts of the kind less numerous
than they have been of late.
Wrote to McEwen & also to Hurlily now Sergeant at Albury but who was
with me as a Turnkey for a long time in Melbourne.
Took a short walk with Tyrer, came home & spent a very lazy evening
rendered however somewhat interesting by my glancing at an old Diary kept
by me on the Voyage from England, as also a letter written a few days after I had
landed in Australia. What a strange world it then seemed, what a tale I could
have told had I but merely stopped a month in Melbourne & then returned to
England. Now habit has made what appeared at first remarkable, commonplace
& I fear there is now little that I should think strange enough to amuse friends
of the old Country if ever I am happy enough to be again among them.
July 28 Monday 1856
This was the day set apart for the Election of Members of the Local Court of
Beechworth, the Court at which all disputes with regard to miners work are
decided by men chosen by the Diggers to represent them.
104 Castieau is referring to Ollendorffs French language instruction manual, already into its
9th edition in 1861.


There have lately been many opinions expressed coinciding in the
unfairness of rules made by the Court in existence for the last six months &
it has even been openly stated that the members being nearly all ?Bosses? or
Large Claim Holders employing men had passed laws beneficial to
themselves but highly injurious to the individual Digger.
It was therefore thought that the possessors of Miners Rights who alone are
qualified to vote would muster in force at the election to day & endeavour to
instil some new blood in the Court then to be formed.
A barricade was erected & arrangements made to divide in the event of a
contest the Ayes from the Noes. This was in front of the Star Hotel the
Balcony of which formed a very convenient Hustings on which none but the
Candidates, their proposers & seconders and the private friends of a
Constable in Charge were allowed to assemble.
Captain Price was of course as perpetual president of the Court in the
Chair & Captain Murray on being loudly called for to form one of the
umpires to decide upon majority or minority took his place alongside of the
worthy Resident Warden.
July 29 Tuesday 1856
MONDAY [contd]. Several members were elected almost unanimously
excepting on the part of a well known head agitator, a blacksmith of the name
of Hodgson who vociferated what looked at a distance like bitter curses but
which were merely questions to the different candidates; however he was told
to ?Dry up? and business proceeded tolerably briskly until Mr Kentish was
proposed, against whom there appeared an evident disinclination from a
large body of the crowd. When his name was put to the vote there appeared
to me to be an equal number of Miners Rights for and against, however the
Chairman decided Mr Kentish to be elected. The miners opposed to him
were at this very indignant and loudly protested such was not the case and
refused to allow the business of the day to proceed unless Kentish resigned or
the Miners Rights were counted for and against him. Their demands were
however not complied with & the rest of the business of the day was
consequently got through amidst great confusion, but what was done very
few, & 1 am not one of the number, knew or I fear cared.
In the evening some Tipperrary boys assaulted three or four mounted men
who were returning home & a general scrimmage ensued. Mr Price the
Resident Warden went himself to the field of battle and exerted himself in
swearing in to the service of her Majesty
July 30 Wednesday 1856
(Monday) all he could see on the road or on the spot not implicated in the
riot; little mischief was done & the Lock Up was soon full of the drunken &
riotous. In the meantime the Town was in a state of alarm. The Treasurer?s


wife received information that a large sum of money had been taken away
from the Treasury, a friend of mine heard a detailed account of the escape of
all the prisoners under my charge & the wife of a constable was condoled
with on the murder of three police officers (names unknown) who had been
sacrificed on the road to the Woolshed by an infuriated mob.
On leaving the place of Election in the afternoon I went in company with
Tyrer & Mr Martin the Surveyor to the Post Office where Mr Froste the
Postmaster regaled us with Bread & Cheese & Old Tom.
Mr Froste told us also he had sent in his resignation but I suppose as a
gentle hint to me wished me to understand he had done so but yesterday.
Fie is about to become a publican & seems very sanguine of making
a speedy fortune. I hope he may, but think he throws high. A Salary of
�430 per annum and a good House is no poor Stake against a Trade for
which in my opinion he is unsuited & which is of late days frequently the
reverse of remunerative.
In the evening I went through the town for I was sick of the dullness of
my quarters,
July 31 Thursday 1856 [still Monday]
alas the streets were nearly as gloomy.
Went to the Freemason?s Hotel and was invited by the landlord to take a seat
in the parlor. Dr Murphy was there and a Mr Rao. I chatted with them &
shouted glasses for the three which evidently opened their hearts for they
began to tell me of certain intentions Murphy had of offering himself to the
Electors of Beechworth as their Representative in the Parliament about to be
formed. Now Dr Lee in the Woolshed is also a Candidate & as the latter
gentleman has not been in the district many months & Murphy is
comparatively an old hand the latter would of course think it infra dig for his
contemporary to step into a position of importance over his head as it were,
& hence the contest. (As for the rest) neither of them it is said (has a long
purse) and how they mean to live while serving their constituents in
Melbourne, this deponent knoweth not.
Went with Murphy to the Star Casino, saw a number of men dancing
together and one or two heroes exulting in the importance of a female partner.
They were great men however let it be understood. Smoke noise and confusion
made up the fun of the Casino so I soon cut it & made a call upon Mrs Tyrer
and her son, stayed a short time with them & then went home & got to bed,
not much exhilerated by my evening out of doors.
August 19 Tuesday 1856
After Dinner I accompanied Mr Brett to the Wesleyan School Room where
a Tea Meeting or as it was called Soiree was being held.
The Room was very crowded & Mr Price the Resident Warden occupied
the chair.


It was a very quiet affair altogether, speech, & then chorus, then speech
again. All was very well until the Rev. Mr Symons the President of the Young
Mens Association began to talk about Books & among other remarks
uncomplimentary to Fiction, held Bulwer & Dickens up as deserving
reprobation. This was coming it rather too strong & I felt rather disgusted.
Dickens had however painted a Stiggins & a Chadbrand 105 & the president
of the Young Mens Association found the Cap rather too much his size &
hence I suppose the indignation. After a few more speeches & choruses the
meeting broke up. I went home and took a glass of beer with Mr Brett.
August 20 Wednesday 1856
Received a letter from Mather & from it learned that my private letter to the
Sheriff had been made public by him and that in consequence my friends in
Melbourne believe I am about to be married. (I wish I was.)
The day?s proceedings somewhat varied by Mr Bennett?s visiting the Gaol
& preaching to the prisoners. After the Service as it was raining heavily the
Rev. Gentlemen walked into my quarters and remained till the Storm abated.
Willing to know what sort of disciplinarian our new Minister is, in speaking
of last night?s Soiree, I intimated that I was very well pleased with everything
at it excepting the terms of reprobation which were used to Dickens works of
Fiction. ?Mr Bennett had (he said) never read Dickens? & this statement far
from tended to exalt him in my estimation.
Went for a walk after Muster with Tyrer & in the evening was visited by
him. We sat talking together till past midnight. Flaving got tired of a hairy
face I have shaved off my beard but have felt rather ill effects in consequence
being troubled with a violent rheumatic pain in my head.
I wish I could get satisfactory tidings from Melbourne. The state of
suspense in which I am in renders me uneasy & restless.
News reached Beechworth this morning of a decided ?sticking up? case at the
Yackandandah. Three men entered the Flome of a squatter, fired at him, ill used
a person who was a visitor at the time, ransacked the House and went their way.
A Baker who lived adjacent was afterwards robbed in the same fashion.
August 30 Saturday 1856
There was a great manifestation this morning in the Gaol Yard. All the
persons (about ten) who had been arrested on suspicion of being concerned
in the Robbery at Osborn?s Station were placed in a line & the inmates of the
House when it was robbed were brought one by one to endeavour to pick out
the real Simon Pures. 106
105 Mr Chadband, a hypocritical parson in Bleak House, who had ?an oily smile? and a ?flabby
paw? (ch. 25). The Rev. Stiggins in Pickwick Papers was a hypocritical Deputy Shepherd of
the Ebenezer Temperance Association.
106 A colloquialism for the ?real or authentic person?, based on an eighteenth-century play in
which Simon Pure, a Quaker, is impersonated by another character.


But one at all satisfactory identification was made. The others were but I
think, & he is very like & so on. I firmly believe that had I taken ten ordinary
prisoners whom I knew to be locked up at the time the Robbery took place,
some of them would have been as nearly sworn to as the men paraded to day.
The one that as I said, was satisfactorily identified was sworn too by a most
respectable person & one who evidently took every opportunity during the
outrage to note the faces of the robbers on his memory.
Eventually all the others were discharged from the Police Court rather to
the disgust of one or two zealous officers who had captured men & longed
for the �BO reward offered by Mr Osborn for the conviction of each of the
men who attacked his house.
Attended a meeting of the Church committee in the afternoon, in the
evening paid a visit to Dr Pontin, then purchased some ... clothing & a Hat
at the total expense of �5.12.6, I expect about �3 over the value.
August 31 Sunday 1856
Up by times had a jolly good bath & enjoyed my breakfast all the more for it.
Went to Church in the morning sporting for the first time at Beechworth
a ?Bell Topper?.
Spent the evening at home reading Night & Morning. Received this day a
letter from Mr Morrison, Manager of the Branch Bank of N.S. Wales in this
town, on Church Committee Business.
September 1 Monday 1856
A great day in the annals of Beechworth. General Holiday applied for to the
Government on the plea of celebrating the Peace but in reality for the
purpose of collecting a crowd to see the Foundation Stone laid of the
Beechworth Hospital. 107
Last night the District was visited by what may be (without exaggeration)
termed a fearful Storm. From about one o clock until five it thundered
Lightened & Rained incessantly. The Thunder too was extra loud, the
lightning particularly forked & the rain in deluge poured. The Holiday
wishers of course were in the dumps & despaired of their procession turning
out a credit to the District. However at daylight the clouds had cleared away,
the Sun shone out warm & bright and the Roads from the very heavy rain
were washed clean & were better for walking than even before the wet.
107 The Ovens and District Hospital, the earliest hospital in this region (Albury followed in 1861,
Wangaratta not until 1871), a philanthropic initiative but heavily subsidised by government
grant (Woods, Beechworth: A Titan's Field, pp. 85-86). Only its facade survives, restored after
the hospitals demolition in 1946, as a memorial to the towns pioneers. See Tom Griffiths,
Beechworth: An Australian Country Town and Its Past (Richmond, Vic.: Greenhouse Publications,
1987), p. 71. Castieau was for two years the President of the Hospital Committee, testament
(he claimed later) to his being one of the able men' of the country. See Public Record Office
Victoria, VPRS 3991/P Box 1005 Item no. 78/05106, Castieau to Chief Secretary, 1878.


I dressed myself in Sunday Togs & at about half past eleven joined in the
Procession that was to march to the Hospital Building. There were in that
procession assembled all the town, Merchants & Storekeepers, Coroner &
Doctors, Barristers & Attorney, Government Officers, Members of the Local
Courts, Young Men?s Association & Miners &c &c. The whole of the people
had a most prosperous appearance and all seemed in health & spirits though
by far the most promising feature of the whole was the Children, about 60
or 70 of whom belonging to the Wesleyan
SEPTEMBER 2 Tuesday 1856 [i.e. September 1 Monday 1856 contd]
School had a place in the procession. The little things all looked plump &
rosy were without exception well dressed & showed from their appearance
that they must necessarily all be possessed of the Comforts of Home. About
Two thousand people of all classes were gathered around the procession
& not a careworn countenance was discernible among the number. No
beggars, no silent Hollow cheeked misery famishing but not outwardly
complaining, was there to meet the gaze. Thank God we have left all such in
?Merry England?.
September 6 Saturday 1856
This morning on reading The Ovens and Murray Advertiser with the usual
listlessness which that not over bright piecemeal Organ generally] induces I
was surprised into emotion by the sudden sight of my own name & on
reading the Paragraph in which the phenomenon occurred I found myself
abused most royally. I was charged with rushing out of my Hole one night &
violently siezing some respectable well dressed individual then ferociously
dragging him to the Lock Up, having him confined all night & then failing
to produce any charge before the Magistrate the next morning.
This all arose from an act of charity. I saw a poor fellow wandering about
who upon being questioned accused himself of having committed
Embezzlement & stated he had no Home & was hungry & tired. I took him
to the Lock Up as I thought he was suffering from Delirium Tremens. There
he got something to eat & then turned into his blankets like a tired dog, quite
worn out.
I was late at the Police Court in the morning and as the Stipendiary had a
down upon me for not giving him some prisoners for some work he wanted
done, as soon as he heard my name mentioned in the Case, he took the
opportunity of my absence to dismiss it
September 7 Sunday 1856 [i.e. Saturday contd]
rather contemptuously. A word from a Sneak who envies me my
independence to the Reporter caused The Ovens and Murray to thunder
condemnation of my gross tyranny.


In the heat of resentment on first reading the Slander, I wrote a letter to the
Editor of the Newspaper & spoke my mind pretty freely not only of the
article itself but of the causes that led to it & among them I reckoned Captain
Price?s discourtesy in so hastily dismissing the charge. 108
September 8 Monday 1856
The man whom I was accused of unlawfully arresting was brought before the
police court this morning and remanded for Medical Treatment for Delirium
Tremens. The poor fellow?s misfortune was a great triumph for me as it
proved me wrongfully vituperated.
September 13 Saturday 1856
Mr Mason the Inspector of Police called to get some Cabbage Plants from the
Garden. I was in bed having been up rather late over night.
Dr Crawford came about half past nine, he transacted his business & then
told me he was going to the Quartz Reef. I hired a Horse & accompanied him.
We had a beautiful ride, having to pass across a fine plain called Boman?s
Forest. It must I should say be very fertile, at any rate the Cattle running upon
it are very fat. The Wattle trees are in full bloom & look exceedingly handsome.
The perfume from them is extremely agreeable & reminded me of something
between the English Hawthorn & Heliotrope. The Blossom is Yellow & as it
grows in heavy bunches, the Trees at a distance have something [of] the
appearance of Laburnums. The Flower consists of a succession of little balls
something like Flax in appearance.
We had to pass also between two High Ranges. The Road is called the Gap
& is what its name implies. The Road is very bad & from its steepness even
horsemen are obliged to dismount; how Loaded Drays can get up & down I
can not conceive. The Ruts however plainly showed that they did do it in
some way or other. It must however be hard work. We passed one Drayman
with his loading all on the Ground, he had been obliged to empty his Dray
twice within a
September 14 Sunday 1856 [i.e. Saturday contd]
Mile. While on the Gap and in the plain we got a good view of the Snow on
the Buckland mountain. It appeared very deep & looked like a heavy white
cloud when shining in the sun.
The Doctor is well known along the road & stopped to have a chat &
necessarily a Nobbier at all the Refreshment Houses. Nice tidy English wives
in general belong to the happy dogs who keep these little rural Restaurants,
and every one of the said wives has a baby & generally speaking a young one.
The Doctor had generally attended the said babies advent into the world &
consequently knew all about the mothers.
108 Subsequently, Castieau received an apology from the newspaper.


We arrived at Mr Oliver?s Hut about two o clock. The Doctor had come to
visit him having heard of his being ill, indeed having been sent for. Mrs
Oliver made us have some lunch & then her brother kindly consented to
show me the Reef. This was very kind of him as he evidently objected to
climbing up the Hill. The doctor would not himself venture.
The Reef is situated at the top of a very steep hill, down which a tramway
is being constructed for the purpose of running trucks containing the Quartz
from the top to the bottom.
The plan intended is for the Full Truck going down to run the empty one up
the top. I almost think the incline is too great for the scheme to answer well.
I found the men very busy in their Claims and got a specimen or two of
the auriferous Quartz.
SEPTEMBER 15 Monday 1856 [i.e. September 13 Saturday contd]
The Labor of getting it out is immense, & as until the Quartz is crushed
there can be no return, a large claim involves a considerable outlay.
Messrs Johnson & Oliver I believe have already spent �2OOO pounds & will
have to spend much more before they will even if fortunate reap any benefit.
A tunnell from the claim to the top of the Range of 98 feet in length is being
cut through the solid rock in order to convey the Quartz to the tunnell I
before spoke of. It is done principally by blasting.
We rode home in good style & I certainly did not begrudge the 30/- I had
to pay for the Horse Hire, although riding would be an expensive luxury if
often-times indulged in. The Price of a Horse for the day seems high but with
Hay at �6O a ton as it is at present I think it can but be expected.
I took Tea at the Doctor?s and found Pontin gloriously ?Sprung?. After
much difficulty the Doctor & myself managed to get the stupid fellow to
bed, although much against his inclination.
The Candidates for the Eastern Province or rather four of them, Williams,
Hervey, Highett & Stewart addressed the electors of the Upper House this
evening. Twas but a poor display of Oratorial powers & as one Candidate
acknowledged, in his opinion the Upper House was bound to bow to the
wish of the lower, & another of them thought there was no necessity of men
sitting in it having any particular Talent. I am afraid our House of Lords will
be a slow Place to spend an evening at.
September 28 Sunday 1856
Went to Church this morning. Contributed to the Collection, and also lent
Mr Brett a Pinch of silver to put in the Plate or rather Box used for handing
amongst the congregation.
Pontin called in the afternoon & had a cup of tea with me.
Went to Tyrer?s in the evening and afterwards brought him over to my
place, talked a long time & then said good night & went to bed.


Have little pleasure in a retrospect of my life for the last month or two.
I am getting lazier, more careless, less zealous, less thoughtful, less
considerate, less Hopeful.
My way of life is too solitary for my disposition. My mind has not been
sufficiently cultivated to enable me to take pleasure in my own society & there
is none other open to my entrance but leads to dissipation & sotting. My Salary
is spent as soon as it is earned, & all I can do or have succeeded in doing, is to
keep clear of debt & obtain a name for honorable regularity in the settlement
or conduct of all money transactions.
God has been very merciful to me or the many times that I have tempted
His Mercy would have long since overthrown and trampled me in the Dust.
The weather was wet again to day & the Roads as soft as ever. From the
camp to the Township in soft weather there are as many difficulties to
encounter as a ship has in the English Channel.
October 3 Friday 1856
Received Pay for the month of September. Settled with the Turnkeys &
returned the Abstract signed to the Deputy Sheriff.
This was Nomination Day for Beechworth Candidates. I went into the
Township. Mr Cameron late Member for the District, Mr Smyth a Digger, Dr
Lee, and the renowned Thomas Mooney were nominated and successively
addressed the electors. The show of hands was decidedly in favour of Cameron,
a Poll was demanded & the Election is fixed to take place on the 14 th of October.
It augurs well for the discrimination of Beechworth that Mr Thomas
Mooneys Humbug was not given much scope. He was soon shut up & then
said hed retire from the Contest. Some Elector in the crowd thanked him for
his consideration. Professor Carey, a Black Barber then advertised himself and
was violently gesticulating, when his discretion called him away as a Brickbat
flew very close to his head & of course no one could tell how many were
winging their way in its track. Niggers heads are thick but their contact with
brickbats is not exactly pleasant to their owners, & so Professor Carey sloped.
Saw a Woman I had known in Melbourne. She was cutting a Dash and said
she was married on the Woolshed. Went to the Casino in the evening. Played
a Rubber of Whist with Messrs Goodsman, Beasley & Jamieson.
October 14 Tuesday 1856
The Great Polling day for the District of Beechworth. Messrs Cameron &
Smith with Dr Lee were the Candidates.
Not much excitement. Thanks to the Ballot the town indeed was duller
than usual & but for the Public Houses being decorated with Leaves &
Wattle Flower a stranger would almost have thought that some revered
inhabitant had gone dead, so silent and solemn was the District.
I voted for Cameron & induced three of my officers to do the same.


In the evening I dined with Messrs Morrison & Styles of the Bank of
N.S. Wales. We were very merry during the afternoon and did as much
mischief as we could with safety, the Police being tremendously severe.
We therefore confined our idle tricks to pelting the Returning Officer
and Scrutineers with nut-shells & other harmless missiles. As Styles was
Electoral auditor this playfulness on his part was most appropriate and
produced a pleasing effect.
Got home early & turned into bed after seeing all was right in the Gaol &
mustering the prisoners.
October 15 Wednesday 1856
The Ovens and Murray Advertiser in its impression of this day announced Mr
Cameron to be the successful candidate by a majority of upwards of 200 over
his opponents.
Busy all day making out the Calendars for the Sessions which commence
to-morrow.
In the evening went for a short time to Froste?s place. It is a most rowdy
house. There is a violin and an apology for a Drum to these instruments, Two
or three girls dressed in Ball Costume figure away to the delight of their
partners and fifty or sixty others of the sterner sex. The latter however dance
many of them in pairs which certainly does not in my eyes increase the gaiety
of the festive scene.
Called at the Constitution Office and gave Nixon a copy of the Calendar.
Came home & went to bed.
Received a visit from a lady now living on the Woolshed (mum).
October 16 Thursday 1856
The first day of the General Sessions. Sported my old uniform & astonished
the Beechworth officials with my gorgeous array.
Nothing particular occurred through the day. In the evening I called in for
a short time at Dr Crawford?s and had a chat with Butler and Mr King.
Afterwards went to Tyrer?s and had a glass of Whiskey with him. Such a dry
lump of official suspicion as Tyrer I never before encountered. On entering
his house I playfully remarked that I was come to see Mrs Tyrer. My Red Tape
abortion said he understood me & asked me why I was offended & would
not come to see him. I had not patience scarcely to tell him how I hated to
have such simple words as I had used pondered over & scrutinised. I had not
seen Mrs Tyrer for a fortnight & had met him several times during that
period and so in playful politeness I had remarked when I came in that I
called to see his mother Mrs Tyrer. The deluded ninny up to his neck in
?Camp? diplomacy shook his head and scarcely appeared satisfied so to show
my friendliness I helped myself out of the bottle without waiting to be asked
and smoked a cigar I saw lying on the table (Puff).


December 8 Monday 1856
Nethercott my Head Turnkey complained to me of having been annoyed by
an ex-prisoner on Sunday. Nethercott had been to the Woolshed & was
returning home when he called at the Alliance Hotel for a drink. Healey a
man who some time since was in Gaol for 14 days, there accused him of
tyranny & bullied him before several other people, inviting him to fight &
daring him to come again down the Creek.
Nethercott is a very respectable man and one who simply complies with the
Orders he receives from me. He is very sober & would not I am sure molest
or say a disrespectful word to any person unless first insulted. I therefore
advised him to summon Healey & he accordingly did so.
Tis a most annoying thing for a Government Officer to have to receive
insult when he knows he has merely performed his duty. The cry of ?Joe?
seems puerile and beyond being cared for by a man of sense but yet as it is
intended to insult & annoy, none but the most callous can hear it without
getting out of temper or feeling humiliated.
December 9 Tuesday 1856
Very little to do in the office and very little inclination on my part to get
through even that as it was of an uninteresting routine description.
Nethercott appeared against the man who had insulted him on Sunday &
gained the Case. The Defendant was fined �3 & 12/6 Costs.
December 11 Thursday 1856
Received a letter and Portion of a newspaper containing the news of the
arrival of the Royal Charter. Received it from Joe who told me all was going
on well at his house.
The Constitution 109 of this day contained a paragraph representing the
desirability of a Beechworth Garrick Club being formed.
In the evening I was visited by eight or nine gentlemen, among them was
the Editor of The Constitution who stated he had come with the intention of
talking to me about the practicability of getting up an institution of the kind,
we however had little talk on the subject as every one of my guests seemed
rather rowdily inclined.
Martin, Morrison & Beasley looked in arrayed in Fancy Garbs & with the
intention of assuring me as the proprietor Mr Beasley observed, ?That the
dresses had arrived?.
Went down the street had a good laugh at the dresses & then went &
inspected a number of others that Beasley & Co have imported.
Came home to bed to which I retired as soon as I had satisfied myself all
was correct in the Gaol.
109 The Constitution and Ovens Mining Intelligencer, a Beechworth paper (1856-1868).


December 13 Saturday 1856
Felt rather Seedy all day, got however through my business without difficulty.
Received an invitation to attend a meeting for the purpose of forming a
Garrick Club. Went and met Twelve Gentlemen who were desirous to
establish such a club.
I was voted to Chair and we discussed the subject for more than an hour. Every
one seemed very well pleased with the rational manner in which all conducted
themselves as of late anything like sensible recreation has never been attempted.
We established ourselves into the Club and then appointed a Committee
to draw up Rules for the guidance of the members. I am on the Committee
and shall certainly try to make our association successful.
After the meeting we all adjourned to the Rooms of Mr Rocklitz, this
gentleman plays well and has a fine piano in capital tune, we had several songs.
After this I am sorry to say, I and two or three others began carrying on our
old tricks & I found myself at last with Messrs Telford & Nixon doing supper
at the Star Hotel at two o clock in the morning. After that we had a game of
cards at which we played till three when we left to go home to bed.
This has been an exceedingly dissipated week. I must certainly turn over a
new leaf or else sacrifice Health & Sobriety.
December 19 Friday 1856
My diary has again got several days in arrears. I have however been leading
the same fast and unprofitable life as I have previously reported.
Forget how I spent the evening although I believe I was knocking about
as usual.
Now I remember I received an invitation to take Supper at Winter?s Hotel,
and when I got there I found fifty or sixty persons assembled together with
most of whom I was acquainted.
Morrison & Beasley accompanied me and we three with Dr Hopkins &
Mr Shells played Loo until supper time. I lost a few shillings at the end of
the evening.
The supper was a very excellent one but the guests were not very amusing.
1 tried to sing ?The Steam Arm?, but made a lamentable failure. Got away
with Keefer, Beasley, Parry & Hopkins. We all went to Keefer?s where we
played the devil to the best of our ability. Pulled poor Birch out of bed,
shrieked, Stormed, Howled & sang until nearly four o clock in the morning.
Pandemonium broke loose was in my estimation nearer typified this night
than at any period that ever came under my notice. Got home in a borrowed
hat with a black Face, Buttonless Shirt & Waistcoat open from top to bottom.
December 25 Thursday 1856
Wrote a few lines for Wilson. 110 Wretched or rather ?Common Place?.
110 Probably Edward Wilson, editor of The Argus.


Went to find out what time Morrison dined. Found him busily writing.
Le Mair, anxious to provoke excitement proposed a drink & we polished off,
without trouble a bottle of stunning Champagne.
The Contractors to the Government sent plums & other requisites for a
plum pudding for the prisoners. They got it and I gave them some bottled
beer to help wash it down.
Dined at Morrison?s, drank pretty heavily of champagne. Went for a stroll
with Keefer and Morrison. Called on Mr Clarke and had some tea with him.
Fired off on all sides volumes of Chaff principally directed against Keefer,
who had advertised for a Housekeeper.
Went from Clarke?s to the Eldorado intending to do a quiet glass of
?Schweppes?. Found a party who had been dining together. Got pulled into the
Room, and were invited to join their festivity. Had some capital singing &
I thundered forth a recitation which was listened to with becoming gravity
(more I expect than it deserved). I mean to try and get hold of a good Comic
Recitation. I cannot sing and it is awkward to do nothing.
Got home at Two o clock.
December 26 Friday 1856
Really this day has been distressingly hot. News arrived that the Governor Sir
Henry Barkly had reached Melbourne. Dont care much about it though,
feeling tolerably careless about politics of any description.
Forwarded a Return asked for in Parliament in reference to the employment of
prisoners. By this Return the enquiring mind of the Honorable Member who
called for it will get about as much information as if he had put a question in
Greek to an Australian aboriginal. However I have done my duty and followed
the instructions I received with the Return.
Went for a stroll in the afternoon after Muster. There was a Greasy Pole erected
in High Street on which at a short distance from the top was placed a Cabbage
Tree Hat with a Five Pound note attached to the Crown; this was to be the
property of any person who could reach it by climbing.
Saw a good many unsuccessful competitors and left one enterprising lad
trying hard to reach the prize. At this place the Police interfered with some
violently drunken man, a squabble ensued in which the Police got rather the
worst of it, and their prisoner escaped for the time but was afterwards captured.
December 31 Wednesday 1856
This turned out a wretchedly wet & cold day.
There was to be this evening a Bal Masque at the Eldorado Hotel and
I made up my mind to go.
Beasley called on me in the evening & I accompanied him to Fisher?s Hotel
where a Panorama of the Siege of Sebastopol was exhibited. The Price of
Admission was 5/- rather a lot although I went principally because it had
been got up by Wilson.


The Weather was still gloomy and the streets very muddy, we went however
to the Eldorado had a nobbier and a look at the Fancy Dresses. I then was
obliged to go home as my Lunatics wanted looking too. I dressed and was
going to the Bal Masque when the rain again fell heavily. It was now
midnight. I threw open the doors and let in the New Year, sat for a while and
then turned into bed. And so ends 1856. What will /37 produce? 1856 has
made me perhaps a wiser, alas I fear not a better man. Am I not more selfish,
less careful of the feelings of others? I fear I am. Let me reflect and God make
me spend 1857 more creditably.
February 3 Tuesday 1857
Awoke feeling far from well. The weather is very hot & oppressive & I am
afraid I drank last evening rather more brandy & water than was prudent.
Sent Joe The Ovens and Murray Advertiser, very little however in it, shows
however I do not quite forget his existence. In the evening at Mr Clarks
invitation I went to his house; on the road Mr Banks the Inspector of Police
called us into his quarters and we smoked a pipe with him after which we all
proceeded to Clark?s house.
Clarke, I and Butler afterwards adjourned to the Eldorado and the
Concert; while there I went into a room in which was Le Mair, Miss
O?Donovan & some other of her friends, sat here longer than I ought, Miss
O?Donovan is so kind and bewitching I had great difficulty in keeping my
ugly paws from clawing her pretty bust; am afraid I did flirt sufficiently to
annoy Le Mair, Wont do it in future?.
Came home after saying good bye to Martin & Butler.
February 6 Friday 1857
Called at Beasleys this morning and accompanied him to the Eldorado where 1
met Coulen & received an invitation to dine with him & his Company.
Went in the afternoon. Got very spoony upon a young lady who is
stopping in the house. Gave her a brooch and made myself very hot and
uncomfortable by indulging in unsatisfactory though exciting caresses.
February 8 Sunday 1857
A letter from McEwen. The Weather still oppressively hot. Went to church
in the morning, afterwards lunched at Dr Crawford?s. Butler spent a portion
of the afternoon at my place, and Mr Wackerow [?] also called. After Muster
went to the Eldorado Hotel and had a chat with Miss Hamilton, Coulen &
Pierce. Then a talk with Miss O?Donovan & her lover Le Mair.
Miss O?Donovan and her beau accompanied me home & had tea at my
place. A heavy thunder storm accompanied by much rain detained the happy
couple till nine o clock, at which hour I wrapped the young lady well in coat
and boots of mine. Lent Le Mair a Great Coat and cap, and then lighted
them home.


Miss O?Donovan is a very nice lively girl and one that I should like a week
or two with amazingly well, and should not begrud[g]e any expense to make
her happy during her visit. I hope she will make Le Mair a good wife; that
she will make him jealous is certain, but that she will give him cause is to be
hoped improbable.
Really I should like the Puss for a charming plaything but it is such a very
very serious affair getting spliced.
Two Glasses of Claret 3/-
March 19 Thursday 1857
Engaged during the morning in the office.
In the afternoon was out with Beasley. In the evening went to the Bank,
from the Bank to Ickerson?s where I played Cards (Vingt Un for very trifling
stakes). Stewart was with me. We remained late and did not come away till
nearly two o clock in the morning.
Mrs Ickerson and I were partners in Vingt Un. I made in addressing her a
very awkward but quite unintentional mistake. Calling her ?My dear?
I blushed up to the eyes but do not believe Ickerson noticed the faux pas and
Mrs Ickerson if she did, gave me credit for having made a mistake and took
no notice of it.
Stewart noticed it however & chaffed me very much after we left, though
at the time he did not change a muscle of his countenance.
March 22 Sunday 1857
Intended going to Church but was prevented by Burke 111 who offered to lend
me his horse to ride to the Woolshed. Unfortunately it came on wet and so I
did not take the trip.
The evening was remarkably wet and there was no alternative but to stay
at home. I read a little, smoked a little, drank a little, thought a little, and
then saw all was right in the Gaol and went to bed.
My position sometimes causes me considerable uneasiness. The fact cannot
be disguised that during this last two months I have lived beyond my income.
Unfortunate in several instances, foolish in others. I lent �lO and now see no
chance of recovering it, another time I purchased at Auction unnecessary
articles at several pounds expense, and a few days since I had to lend Dr
Murphy �3.5 though I was very short of Cash at the time.
I must certainly pull in and intend now to be a great deal more careful and
to see if possible instead of getting into debt. If I do not of course I can expect
nothing but difficulties and dangers. I cannot compete on my salary with
those who have double the amount coming in and there?s the whole secret.

the senior police officer in Beechworth. He was later superintendent, before he embarked in
1860 on the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition to cross Australia from south to north.
Castieau was a regular associate of Burke's during 1857 and 1858.

May 10 Sunday 1857
My Diary has not been opened from this Date until the Second of June. 112 I have
little to look back at that gives me satisfaction to remember & it will not therefore
occupy long for me to detail what has happened of importance.
I have been a constant visitor at Le Mare?s house, too constant a one in fact
for I have neglected my business to fritter my hours away in talking nonsense
or worse to Mrs Le Mare.
I have been passing the evenings generally in Card Playing. Have lost at least
seven or eight Pounds and have embarrassed my circumstances in consequence.
I have given away to drink and Tobacco and taken more of each than is
beneficial to my Constitution or Pocket.
My business from these excesses is become irksome to me & I do no more
than is actually necessary to prevent myself getting into disgrace. How
different from the Zeal I felt and showed some twelve months since.
112 Castieau is writing about the events of May in June, possible with a calendar to prompt his
memory.


I feel in fact going fast down Hill & unless it pleases God to give me
strength to pull up again, the future is black & gloomy.
There is a chance yet left I am I hope generally respected, am not helplessly
involved and with resolution can make myself all right again. So cheer up &
pray Heaven help me.
May 20 Wednesday 1857
Somewhere about this time I dined at the Star with Martin, Hall, one or two
others and Truwhitt a solicitor.
An argument arose relative to the power of constables & the necessity of
individuals yielding themselves without resistance to their Authority when
acting upon Warrant.
Truwhitt maintained that if a man were innocent he need not yield to any
Warrant and that if in resisting being taken into custody such person were to
Kill the Constable the law would hold him not accountable for the
Constable?s death.
I said under such circumstances the person resisting a Warrant would if he
killed the Constable be guilty of Murder as every man is bound to yield himself
to the laws of his Country and that if a Warrant were granted the Constable
would be simply performing his duty when executing it and therefore his
person would be protected by the law, the question of Innocence or Guilt of
the Crime charged in the Warrant having nothing to do with the Case.
The Argument produced a Bet. Truwhitt backed his opinion by betting �5
he was right. I accepted the Bet and the subject was to be decided by Mr
Mayne the Barrister. I won and after considerable quibbling was paid.
June 28 Sunday 1857
Had a little row this morning with a prisoner. He was very aggravating but I
regret to chronicle that I lost my temper and spoke of him to the other
prisoners as a ?Scoundrel?; this is language unbecoming an officer to a
prisoner & it served me right, that the fellow took advantage of my
indiscretion and pretended to feel very much injured. This prisoner is a man
of very bad disposition and has tried his utmost to annoy all the officers of
the Gaol but I ought to have shown more coolness.
June 30 Tuesday 1857
Another very miserable wet day.
Remained at home in the evening amused myself with Reading. Butler was
with me a portion of the day.
We agreed to study French together and I hope the pair of us will show
sufficient perseverance to get some benefit from the plan.
The Visiting Justice was at the Gaol in the morning and tried the prisoner
that I spoke about on Sunday for misconduct. The fellow escaped in


consequence of the irritation he professed to have received at my hands, and
because the Senior Turnkey in giving his evidence made use of a threat stating
that had this prisoner kicked him as he tried to do, He the Senior Turnkey
would have knocked his teeth down his throat. 1 was very much annoyed at
this as the Magistrate would probably leave the Gaol under an impression
that the prisoners were improperly treated and that they were subject to be
bullied or knocked about. I told the Magistrate that if he had any such idea
I must request him to make a full inquiry into the whole system with which
the Gaol is conducted.
July 1 Wednesday 1857
By Jove eight days gone and no entry in my Diary. This inattention will
doubtless be much deplored when in future Ages this valuable Work is
rescued from dust and obscurity to illuminate and instruct the world. Ahem.
Do not remember anything particularly about his day, think I stayed at
home in the evening am not however quite certain.
September 27 Sunday 1857
Went to Church this morning. As the weather was remarkably warm I put on
White Trousers & White Vest. This change astonished the Beechworth Folk
a little and I was chaffed at being a great Swell.
Went to Keefer?s in the afternoon, had a long walk with Keefer &
Morrison. Dined with Keefer & talked Canada during the evening. ll3 Came
home about eleven o clock. Much annoyed this morning at not being able to
find a Ring which I had received some time since belonging to a prisoner,
and who was discharged to-day. I could not find the ring anywhere & so I
suppose shall have to give compensation. The ring is not worth much but the
idea of losing anything of the Kind belonging to the prisoners has made me
feel very uncomfortable.
November 19 Thursday 1857
The Diary has sickened me to think about [how] I have felt so wretched &
weary these many days, without heart & without content.
Since I made my last Entry in this Journal I have purchased some land at
Yackandandah and have to pay for it with Bills at Six & Three Months Date.
The Three Months Bill is for �9O & I shall have a difficulty in meeting it.
Whether I have made a good Spec or not time will show. 1 bought the Land
of a Friend & so of course had to pay more than the usual price.
I have had a Row with the Chinese Protector and with Dr Dempster,
because I refused allowing the China-men to be vaccinated. The Protector
113 Alexander Keefer, a young barrister who had named the site of his log cabin house
Little Canada, 'because the native pines and ravine reminded him of his homeland':
Carole Woods, Beechworth: A Titans Field (Beechworth, 1985), p. 85.


reported me for being uncourteous. I was disgusted with Dempster, but do
not care two pins about the opinion of all the Chinese Protectors or
(Persecutors as they should be termed) in the world. 114
The other day before a very large audience I played Box in Box & Cox &
got through very well, much better than ever I anticipated. It was for the
benefit of the Mechanics Institute.
Began playing Loo the night before Last, or rather the night before that,
lost nearly Five Pounds.
January 1 1859
This diary was not received by me till the end of the month [of December
1958], It was forwarded by Neild in a parcel directed to Mr Long of
Scrutton?s Farm.
There is little worthy of communicating. My Sister presented her husband
with another little girl & the letters I have had from Melbourne acquaint me
that ?Mother and child are doing well?.
The Beechworth Races took place. 1 attended two of the days and made
several bets all of which I lost; one evening I played at Loo and with that
Game and the Races together expended eleven pounds.
Patrick Hamilton, Coulen and a Comic Singer of the name of Pierce have
been giving Concerts at the Eldorado. I went to several of them.
The Wesleyans gave a Fancy Bazaar in aid of the funds for building their
chapel. I went and met a rather nice girl who was acting as Post-Mistress. She
is now engaged to Le Mair and I have been introduced to her by him.
I get along very well with most people but find it a very difficult matter to
save any money. I however intend to try in future to do so.
The Beechworth Garrick Club is established. I am Vice President, we find
however great difficulty in getting the Members to take sufficient personal
interest to keep it together.
Yesterday December 30th 1858, I took an important step in my life?s
journey, that step was getting married. I was attracted at the Church of
England Bazaar held about six weeks since by the many charms and eminent
business capabilities of Miss Moore. We kept a Lottery together, & flirted to
an extent that brought us into notoriety. Polly got very much talked about &
her name severely handled, however we continued to be very much together
& when the Bazaar was over, took plenty of walks, had the usual sweets lovers
indulge in & innumerable quarrels. At length however we made up our
minds to be man & wife. This was on Sunday December 26th; that same
night we agreed to be married on the 30th.
114 The role of the Chinese Protector included regulation of health. There was a large
protectorate established at Beechworth, with more than 5000 Chinese miners in the region
at the time. Ibid., pp. 57-58.


ta * *
I told Polly of my debts & how small were my means she did not seem to
care & so everything settled, we got married & rode away to Everton without
telling the Beechworth Folk anything about it. At Everton we had a nice little
place to ourselves & notwithstanding the heat was great & the flies numerous
& troublesome managed to get on very well. Got home on Saturday. House
much improved, commenced at once a domestic life. Wrote to my sister, told
her of my wedding & sent to Neild for some cards for Mrs C.
January 1 Sunday 1860
Ushered the New Year in by adding the Report of my pistols to the General
noise in the Town. Had a Polka with Polly on the Verandah, a Glass of Wine
& then to bed.
Went through the Accounts found. We commenced the Year with a Debt
of �2OO. Polly and 1 both determined to try & clear it all off during the
twelvemonth. Settled the manner in which we would dispose of the largest of
the Bills.
Went to Church in the evening. Heard Mr Booth preach; he is new to
Beechworth. Liked his sermon though it had two faults, it being
unnecessarily long & having too much repetition.
Walked to Darvall?s found Hall & his family there, returned with them." 5
Ushered the New Year in very pleasantly, made good resolutions & hope to
be enabled to keep them.

115 John Hall married Pollys sister, Dora (Dotty in later diaries), at St Kilda in April 1859.
William Darvall (the first town clerk at Beechworth, from 1856 to about 1870
when he started a legal practice) married another sister, Jenny, in Melbourne in 1857.


Chapter 3: 1870
'TWO GLASSES OF GROG INSTEAD OF ONE'
Having left Melbourne as a single man in 1836, Castieau returned in
1869 with his wife Polly and their six children, soon to become seven.
In the prominent position of Governor of the Melbourne Gaol, Castieau was
soon known to the city?s inhabitants. Walking with a friend near Richmond
one day early in 1870 he passed some boys bathing in the river and ?heard
them call after us ?Mr Castyao??. The prison was so firmly identified with its
governor that within a few years his son would report hearing references on
the Melbourne stage to ?Castieau?s hotel?. 116
On the Victoria Street frontage of the gaol was the governor?s residence,
home to this large family and their occasional servants, some of them selected
from among the prisoners. The diary captures life in these busy rooms, and
the movement back and forth between the residence and the prison. There is
no sense of anxiety about contamination or safety conveyed in Castieau?s
account of the life of the family in the prison environs. The only concern is
whether some of the prisoner servants might abuse the trust placed in them,
to escape. The ready supply of generally trusted servants was a privilege in a
city where the ?servant problem? constituted a constant source of domestic
irritation for the middle classes who employed them.
In spite of the entitlement to cost-free accommodation, the pressing
problem of Castieau?s existence in the 1870s was money. During 1870 he
faced the anxiety of seeing his shares in a mining speculation placed at risk in
legal battles, while the daily account keeping that occupied the end-pages of
the diaries kept him all too aware of the family?s perilous position. One resort
was to borrow against one?s life insurance policy, an exercise described at
some length later in the year. There would be no relief in the next decade
from this pressing concern for financial security, a pressure which one senses
from the diaries was responsible for the chronic ill-health that seems to dog
Castieau and Polly from this time.
Such personal anxieties were compounded by the constant pressure of
accountability for the prisoners and the prison. The danger of prison suicides,
the caring for lunatics until they can be transferred to the asylum, the ever-
present deaths of inmates in a state of delirium tremens from the effects of
drink?all emerge frequently in diary comments.
There are other external threats: this was the year in which the government
appointed a commission to inquire into all the penal establishments in
Victoria. The daily exercise of a prison governor?s duty entailed staying on
watch for threatening outcomes, in this case the pressure to take more

prisoners into an already crowded institution, or to secure more
remuneration from prison labour.
The daily life of the city was a source of relief. Melbourne in 1870 offered
an even richer cultural environment than in Castieau?s first years in the city.
With a population of around 200 000 people the city and its environs hosted
the kinds of institutions which helped define urban living in the Victorian
age; newspapers, magazines, theatres, hotels, libraries, museums, churches,
and shopping arcades; a university, cemeteries, railway stations and a major
shipping port. Young friends of the 1830s had become key figures in the
circles of artists and journalists with whom Castieau associated; from Neild,
especially, he would get support for election to the Yorick Club and his
introduction to Clarke, Shillinglaw, Telo and numerous other writers and
journalists. At the same time, as an influential former denizen of Beechworth,
he had some means of access to the world of politics, chiefly through the
constant Sunday visits to his friend, the member for Ovens, George Kerferd,
whose star would rise while Castieau struggled to keep his visible.
January 20 Thursday 1870
Pleasant Summer?s day.
Jenny 117 spent the day at Mrs Kerferd?s. In the afternoon felt lazily inclined
& went to bed for an hour. Polly followed suit & we remained as long as we
were allowed. I was wanted & had to get up sooner than was intended. Katey
came over in the evening; poor girl she is nearly worn out taking her turn in
watching a dying baby of Mrs Parkyns. The child has been very ill for several
days & lingers on yet though the doctor has no hope of its recovery.
I volunteered to take Katey & Fanny out for a walk & we went into Bourke
117 Polly's sister, married to William Darvall.

Street, after a promenade of that popular locality we went into the Waxworks.
The Exhibition is much improved since my last visit. Some miniature wax
figures were very good, one of the Queen I thought particularly well of. Went
into a fruiterers & bought some fruit for the girls; talking of fruit, Lynch
brought us some very fine plums. He put them very nicely arranged in a box
with vine leaves between them. There was a nice bloom on the fruit & when
the box was put before Cowderoy, who lunched with us, as a case of wax
fruit, he had a good look & then pronounced them to be pretty good.
January 22 Saturday 1870
In the evening took Lucy & Katey Morphy 118 for a walk through Bourke
Street, the poor girls have been kept in close attendance on their sister?s baby
which has appeared to be dying for some days. Lucy & Katey both looked
weary & worn out. There was a great crowd in Bourke Street but nothing
particularly worth seeing. There was not a breath of air & the illuminated
signs at the Places of Amusement burnt as calmly as if they were under cover.
Met Mr Young, Assistant to Gammon the Chemist at Beechworth. He was
at our house in the morning but I was from home. Tried to read, smoked,
took some toddy then went to bed & tumbled for an hour or two before
going to sleep.
This was Dotty?s birthday. She is Six Years old this very day. I gave her a
half a crown & she presided at dessert.
January 23 Sunday 1870
A very hot day wind blowing from the north without change all day.
118 The Morphys resided opposite the gaol. Mrs Morphy ran a boarding house.


Had a little barney with Polly, owing to my reading some cutting remarks
by ?a woman? ?on women? in the Broadway Magazine. I skipped all the hits at
the men & read all the slaps the women got. Polly found me out & called me
deceitful. The weather was so oppressive that it required a great deal of
forbearance to keep good tempered.
Got through the day. Eating, Drinking, sleeping & reading. In the evening
went for a walk. Met Reed 119 of Collins Street & walked with him to
Richmond along the banks of the river, saw some boys bathing & heard them
call after us Mr ?Castyao?. I suppose my appearance will soon be tolerably
well known. At Richmond Reed & I had a glass of beer & then came back
by another route. When I got home I found Emma & Agnes were at our
house. They had no news & did not stop very long.
Seemed to dread going to bed, everything smelling hot & stuffy, laid down
for a time on the sofa, then got up & read till I was tired then went to bed.
January 24 Monday 1870
The weather still if possible hotter, every one nearly worn out. The rooms are
like ovens & opening the windows makes things worse instead of better.
Rose at half past five & went through the Gaol. Went to the Sheriff?s office
in the morning & spoke to the Sheriff about Mrs Gee, he agreed to
recommend her for an increase of salary. Received a Telegram from Darvall
which I took to Kerferd?s office. Kerferd was gone so I put the Telegram
through the letter box. Met Hyland, Governor of Castlemaine Gaol, he was
with a friend, we went & had some shandy gaff. 120
In the evening I strolled down to the Mechanics & had a glance at the
pictures in the English comic periodicals. The Reading Room was very hot
& I could not bring my mind to read. Came home had a pipe & some beer
& then Polly & I had a bath & went to bed. Last night we found the
musquitoes very troublesome so to-day Polly made some curtains. Our bed-
room is a fine room but is much exposed to the sun & has very large
windows; to-night it was terribly close. Bed clothes or even other clothes were
almost out of the question. I tried to sleep but could not, then rolled on to
the floor & stayed there till the musquitoes drove me back to bed again. No
change of wind.
Harry went to school, the holidays being over.
February 2 Wednesday 1870
Very hot to-day.
Did not do much good, knocked about a good deal & drank several noblers.
Had to attend an Inquest this afternoon, another man Died from Delirium
Tremens. The poor fellow was only 26 years of age & appeared strong when
119 Thomas Reed, who ran a small business described as 'a fancy repository', in Collins Street.
120 A mixture of beer and ginger beer.


he was received. He underwent the usual treatment prescribed by Dr McCrea,
that is he was placed under the tap then being restless he was sewn up in
blankets & afterwards 24 leeches were applied to his head. The blankets must
be a terrible punishment in this hot weather; it was pitiful to see the
perspiration in which this poor fellow was in & to hear him ask to be released.
Dr McCrea held a Post mortem in the afternoon at which I was present. The
state of the brain satisfied the doctor as to the cause of death being Delirium
Tremens. I must say however that I have seen a great many apparently worse
cases recover in a very short time & under very simple treatment. The Jury
were rather inquisitive as to the treatment as they said it was rumoured
outside, every body when received in Gaol was put under the tap.
February 3 Thursday 1870
A hot wind to-day, it changed however in the afternoon.
A leading article appeared in The Argus of this morning lauding the
management of Dunedin Gaol & calling attention to a report of the
Governor that the Gaol was more than self supporting, the prisoners having
earned in 1868 more than a thousand pounds over the whole cost of the
Gaol. I thought of making application to be sent to report on the system
adopted at Dunedin as I think I could if allowed do as much with prisoners
as Mr Caldwell the Gaoler at Dunedin. I went down & saw Kerferd & spoke
to him on the subject, he said he would read the article to night & have a
chat if he could with the Chief Secretary to-morrow.
Met a Mr Isod clerk & bailiff at Geelong, he was in company of Lynch & we
had a glass of wine together. Saw Drury, met Crawford. Called upon Mrs Telford
found her looking very well. Mr Sheppard was there & so was Dr & Mrs Brough.
In the evening went into town & read the papers, there was very little new
& the town seemed quiet, Bourke Street being I thought remarkably so.
February 9 Wednesday 1870
A fine day though muggy as if the Bush in the neighbourhood was on fire.
Still troubled very much with dyspepsia & in consequence lowness
of spirits.
Dr Dempster called to see us in the course of the day; his eye seemed very bad
though he appeared in tolerable good spirits. I was not able to talk much with
him as the Visiting Justice came & interrupted us, some reporter accompanied
Mr Panton & a fuller inspection was made than usual. I was very well satisfied
with the Gaol except at the idleness of the greater part of the women. This I
cannot help, nor more can Mrs Gee the Matron. There is no work for them to
do & after the washing for the whole of the Gaol is done & the Gaol itself
cleaned, there is little or no more work & consequently only comparatively few
of the women are at work. To be sure many of the remainder are sick or weak &
others have children to look after, some with one at the breast, yet it is terrible to


see a number of women sitting in the Yards the whole of the day & with no better
thing to do than pick their fingers, when they have devoured the scanty meals
allowed them. These meals now are scanty enough in all conscience & the poor
idle creatures are hungry & ready to fight for an extra potatoe or piece of bread.
Went as usual for a walk as far as the Mechanics this evening. 121 Came home &
went early to bed.
February 10 Thursday 1870
A very hot close day.
Rose at half past five. Read the Rules to the Turnkeys on Parade went
through the Gaol, afterwards visited the Turnkeys Quarters where I had sent
a party of men to try & make them look a little more decent in front, they
are now far from reputable.
Went into town this morning & purchased some articles for Law.
Dempster called in the afternoon & said he intended leaving to-morrow.
His eye I was glad to see was much better.
Interested myself this afternoon in writing a letter to The Argus in reply to
a Leading Article they published last week with regard to Dunedin Gaol &
the management thereof, showed it to Walford who considered I had a right
to send it to The Argus without infringing the Civil Service Regulations so
after getting Polly?s approval of the letter I forwarded it.
Went into town in the evening, looked in at the Mechanics, saw Barclay
there. Jenny was at our house today, she was at Cowderoys last night &
intends going to Geelong on Saturday.
February 11 Friday 1870
A nice day, the wind changed to the South early this morning.
My letter appeared in The Argus this morning & created quite a flutter.
When I went to the Sheriff?s office I found Mr Farie quite excited because I
had mentioned his name in the letter, he was sure however I had not
intentionally annoyed him & I of course declared I had no intention of so
doing. He thought the letter very injudicious. I said I was sorry that was his
opinion, after a little more growling he said, well there?s an end of it so far as
I am concerned & I said I will not annoy you in like manner again.
In the afternoon the Sub Editor of The Argus, evidently the writer of the
article I answered, came to see me & I took him through the Gaol &
expressed my views on prison matters, pointed out to him the want of
employment for the women &c.
Neild wrote to me praising my letter & stating he wanted to write some articles
on Gaols in Victoria. Harriette came to see us in the afternoon; she had been in
Town since Monday. In the evening went with Polly to Cowderoys, they were
not at home so we went farther & called upon Joe & Emma.
121 The Mechanics Institute was at 81 Collins Street.


February 12 Saturday 1870
A nice summer?s day.
In The Argus of this morning a Leading Article appeared in which ?my
taking an erroneous view of the meaning of a previous article? was ?readily
excused? ?in consideration of my evident desire to improve the system in
vogue at the Establishment of which I was the Head?. I was called ?Zealous
& intelligent? & then (without acknowledgement) my views as expressed to
the sub-editor were put forth as the ?correct card?.
In the morning I went to Carter?s & ordered a case of porter. In the
afternoon mustered. Harriette & Emma came after tea, & I walked with
them to the Station saw Harriette into the train & then started Emma by a
car to Richmond. Looked in at the Mechanics & read a little in Punch & the
papers, then came back to the Gaol & took Polly into town, had a walk
through Bourke Street & then home, some toddy & a smoke &C bed.
February 19 Saturday 1870
A warm summer?s day.
Attended Court, a very nasty case was tried. A child of about nine years of
age charged her father with committing a rape upon her. It was terrible to see
the little girl standing in the Witness Box opposite to her father in the Dock
& hear her give her evidence in the coolest & most deliberate manner
possible. The prisoner was defended by the Crown; as he was charged with a
Capital offence his counsel was Myles Garrett Byrne. 122
The Jury brought the prisoner in Guilty of Attempt to commit the offence
& the Judge remanded him for sentence.
This morning while I was in Court Gill sent me a note saying the meeting of
the Shareholders in the Claim was postponed till Monday & two o clock. 123 I
went out of Court & walked down the street with him for the sake of getting
some information. Gill seemed open & fair enough & said I could transfer my
miner?s right if I pleased, he also professed to be confident there was nothing to
be feared from the Jumpers as they had not the shadow of a case & Berrigan was
only doing it to get an interest if possible in the Ground. I stated I had no money
to spend & Gill seemed to imply no money would be wanted. The meeting was
for the purpose of forming a Limited Liability Company.
Jenny returned from Geelong & does not appear to have enjoyed herself at
the Pivot. Godfrey Lotherington 124 came in to stop the night with Harry.
Harry had been with him all day. Went to the Mechanics in the evening.
Took Polly out after I returned from the Mechanics. Bourke Street
very crowded.
122 Miles Garrett Byrne was a prominent Melbourne barrister.
123 Castieau was an investor in a mining speculation, the Portia Gold Mining Company.
124 Castieau?s nephew, son of his sister Emma, about 11 years old at this time (Harry Castieau
was nine).


February 20 Sunday 1870
A nice cool day.
Went to Church this morning with Polly & the Youngsters. Godfrey
Lotherington accompanied us.
After Muster I took the train to Hawthorn & went on to Kew to see
Kerferd, 125 found Mr Anderson Dalziel & Morrison, stopped to tea & had a
long chat about Beechworth people & prospects. Mr & Mrs Kerferd walked
with us to the Car & on the way Kerferd told me he was patiently waiting
his time for office, he wished to gain a reputation as a Barrister before being
made a law officer, he stated also that the present Ministry could not hold
together long & that McCulloch 126 would be likely to make overtures to the
old opposition or constitutional party & if those overtures were accepted the
present Ministry would be beaten & a coalition one formed in its place.
Got to the station in time for the 20 minutes past nine o clock Train. Said
good bye to Morrison & Dalziel when we arrived in Melbourne, got home
by ten o clock.
Polly told me Joe & Emma had been at our house & stopped to tea.
Godfrey went home with his father & mother.
February 21 Monday 1870
A hot wind day, very dusty & most oppressively hot.
Busy in the office in the morning, went into the Gaol & tried a woman for
Impertinence to one of the female officers. I sentenced the prisoner to three
days solitary confinement. She had a child & as soon as she received her
sentence, she sat it down on the floor & walked away. I ordered her to be
placed in the dark cell till she could behave herself, she screamed & refused to
go. I got a turnkey to help the female officers & after a deal of howling &
screaming they dragged her down stairs & into the dark cell. She resisted most
desperately but soon got cool after she was in the cell, so in the afternoon she
was allowed to return to her own cell & take the baby.
Jenny, Dotty, Fanny, Teddy & the baby were at our house, in the evening
or rather afternoon. Polly & her crowd accompanied them to the University;
they rode 13 in a cab.
Attended a meeting of Shareholders in the Portia Mining Company, it was
postponed till to-morrow at four o clock.
Went to the Mechanics in the evening. Purchased four nice pine apples for
a shilling.
125 George Briscoe Kerferd (1831-1889), later Premier of Victoria. Like Castieau, he was born
in England and migrated during the gold rushes. He was a successful brewer and
businessman in Beechworth, his political base, from his election in 1864 for the next 22
years (Australian Dictionary of Biography).
126 Sir James McCulloch (1819-1893), politician and businessman, who was Premier of
Victoria for most of the period 1864 to 1871. He was a liberal, known for policies of land
reform, protection and secular education {Australian Dictionary of Biography) .


March 18 Friday 1870
Great anxiety among the Civil Servants with regard to the proposed
reductions; every officer seems & is no doubt in blissful ignorance as to his
future Screw or position. For my part if they Reduce me still further it will be
almost impossible for me to get on at all, as my expenses are quite up to my
income. The Chief Secretary will however stultify himself if he reduces me
after having just recently approved of my being raised in Class. Mine is a very
hard case as the salary for the office I hold has been so very much reduced
while very few others have been troubled at all & certainly none in the Gaol
Department. My responsibilities have been & are heavy & my pay is not equal
to what I should receive if I were employed in the same capacity in the Old
Country. I feel then very sore on the bare idea of being made any worse off.
March 19 Saturday 1870
A cloudy day, very dusty in the morning. Up at Five o clock as the Military
prisoners were to be removed as the 14th Regt. was proceeding to England
by the Walmer Castle.
At six o clock an officer, 50 men under arms & a drummer arrived at the
Gaol. I handed over 48 men. The officer was about to give the order to
March when I reminded him I must have a receipt for the prisoners. He said
he had no orders to give me one. I told him in reply that the men were in my
custody & I should not let them go without. He looked at his fifty men
under arms & then at me, & wisely at once gave in & signed the receipt like
a lamb; we shook hands & away marched as bad a lot as have left the Gaol
for some time.
Attended at the Court a great portion of the day. The Trentham Murder
case continued. The Jury brought in a verdict of Manslaughter & the
prisoner was sentenced to Ten years on the Roads. In the evening after the
Court was over I took Polly down town & purchased The Australasian. I
forgot to mention that in the morning we went to the Eastern Market where
I purchased four Spanish fowls for ten shillings, when we got back found a
fine cock drowned in the Tank in the fowl yard.
March 20 Sunday 1870
A cloudy day, looked very much like rain about lunch time, when we came out
however it had again become fine. There was a collection for the Sunday School.
I gave each of the children a shilling to put in the plate. Harry however tried to
stick to his & the Collector was kept waiting at the pew door while Polly had a
struggle with the young vagabond to get the money away from him.
After Muster I went by the five o clock train to Kew, & found Kerferd at
home & Morison with him; we had tea, a long chat & glass of colonial wine,
then started for Melbourne, left Hawthorn by the Quarter past nine train &
got home before ten. Kerferd evidently imagines the present Ministry will


not be long in office, he looks forward to a coalition Ministry with
McCulloch at the head, with himself & such men as McMahon members. I
do not see myself how such an alliance can be honestly formed, it is evident
however that the present Ministry will not be allowed to hold the reins long
unless they can manage to dissolve the House. Came home, had some toddy
went to bed no good?; disgusted got up had a pipe & glass of grog took some
pills & went to bed.
March 26 Saturday 1870
A fine day rain appearing to have passed away.
In The Australasian of this morning, there appeared a rub at me for my letter
about Dunedin, this was not so bad however as what happened when I went to
the Sheriff?s Office. There was a letter from the Chief Secretary or rather Under
Secretary calling for an explanation of my conduct in writing letters to The Argus
without leave, in direct contravention of the Civil Service Regulations.
Went into town with Walford & like a fool took some dark brandy & water
at the Railway Station, came however home in time for Muster. After muster
Walford came again with the Sheriff?s authority for the release of Patrick
Niall, for Father Niall he is called or rather is unless he has been unfrocked.
I went into town with Walford & we nobblerised a good deal, he went
home & I looked in at the Mechanics, came home, took a smoke & a big
drop of gin & was quite screwed. Polly was in a great way. I laid on the sofa
& she went to bed. There was a heavy shower of rain fell between twelve &
one o clock to-day & in the evening it appeared as if there would be a heavy
fall of wet; it did not however come.
Polly I am sorry to say is still very weak. I have not behaved well to her &
that I fear has something to do with it. I have not told her about the letter
from the Chief Secretary?s Office.
March 27 Sunday 1870
Woke up about three o clock on the Sofa this morning quite sober but with
a splitting headache, took some pills, got up not at all comfortable or
amiable. Went out in the morning to get some more medicine for Polly, got
it at Wragge?s & had a chat with him, came home. Polly was evidently very
weak & unhappy, a good dinner was brought in but neither of us enjoyed it.
Mustered in the afternoon &C after it was over I went into town & got some
tobacco, in the evening I took Harry to church, came home had a smoke &
a small glass of grog & went to bed.
I have seriously made up my mind from this time forth not to drink any spirits
in the day time & I will try to give up as much as possible drinking spirits at all.
It is evident I cannot stand their effects & I am getting in that way now, that I
have no recollection whatever of anything that takes place when I have got stupid
over a pipe. I must alter & with God?s aid will do so from this time forth.


The children are a serious responsibility & it is sad to reflect what would
become of them if anything happened to me. It makes me a coward when I
think about them & I hope I may yet turn over a new leaf & think of little
else than their future welfare.
April 1 Friday 1870
Weather still fine. General Sessions commenced. I was at the Court portion of
the day but was waiting about at the Sheriff?s office for the Pay. Mr Farie
however did not come to town so I did?ent get it. Dotty dined with us, we had
rabbit pie, it was very nice & bunny evidently rose in the estimation of us all.
This was the second time we have had rabbits since we came to Melbourne.
In the evening I went into town & read the Papers at the Mechanics,
nothing yet done about the formation of a new Ministry, all sorts of rumours
however & very various combinations. The Evening Paper states that nothing
yet is known & I suppose that is most likely. In Bourke Street I met Joe
White & we commenced as usual chatting on different subjects. I asked what
sort of a place the ?Oriental Saloon? was as an article had appeared in The Age
which made it out to be a terribly dissipated place & one that ought to be
put down. It seemed that at first the waitresses had been dressed as [i.e. in]
Bloomers. Their costume was then altered & instead of trousers, they wore
short skirts & spangled dresses. White said it was all humbug so far as the
description of The Age went & asked me to go in for a moment & have a
look. The Age article had evidently excited a good deal of curiosity for
numbers were evidently judging for themselves, among others was the Editor
of The Australasian & several friends. The place is a common Free & Easy,
some girls are strangely but by no means indecently dressed, these act as
waiters & that is all. We did not stop many minutes.
April 3 Sunday 1870
A cloudy day, a little rain in the evening. Took Flarry, Sissy & Dotty to
Church in the morning. After muster Polly & I started for Sandridge but
before we reached the Cab Stand big drops of rain began to fall so Polly got
frightened for her velvet cloak & we returned home.
I did not go out again but passed the time away in reading, amused the
youngsters with some stories from Grimms Goblins' 27 a book I brought a few
nights since. Had a smoke & glass of grog then went off to bed.
This was a very long day. I spent a short time in the Gaol making up my Diary
& it took me an hour to muster. The rest of the day I was mostly reading or
playing with the children. I did think of going to see Kerferd but I fancied he
might be engaged as he is one mentioned as likely to be in the new Ministry.
Yesterday it was stated that he would be Attorney & Wrixon Solicitor
General, there were however no end of rumours & possibly the coming men
127 It is likely that he meant Grimms Fairy Tales.


have not yet been hinted at. A great many Gaol Servants myself among the
number dread the return of McCulloch to power. Sir James may however be
a little more considerate than was Mr McCulloch. 128
April 6 Wednesday 1870
Another fine day, though in the afternoon it was cloudy. Last night the
papers state there was a glorious display in the heavens of the ?Southern
Lights?. Polly & I were however in bed & missed what appears to have been
a glorious spectacle.
Received a letter from Edwin Smith, he has not yet got his money from the
Board of Education. Went to the Police office saw Drury & had a chat with Mr
Sturt who has recently returned from England. Mr Sturt was Visiting Justice
previous to his going home & will be again now he has returned.
This afternoon at three o clock Adolph Rudolph received 25 lashes.
Bamford flogged & the prisoner got very severe thrashing which he bore
almost without flinching & without a groan, most of the Reporters were
present & several members of the legal profession. I expect the next time the
Judges have to sentence a prisoner to be whipped they will give 50 instead of
25 lashes.
Went with C. Smyth Crown Prosecuter & Moore the Chief Justice?s
Associate to the Supreme Court Hotel & had some brandy & water, went
afterwards into town with Ellis & returning met C. Smyth again & went to
his office & got a book Plummer made for me some seven years since &
which Smyth borrowed & took to Melbourne. Polly went for Dotty & Sissy
who had spent the day at Mrs Elliotts. I followed but missed them &
returned by myself. Went into Bourkc Street for a stroll & met Dr Taylor,
returned by nine o clock. 129
April 18 Monday 1870
Easter Monday. A very fine day & taken advantage of by the good folk of
Melbourne who seemed determined to have an Easter Outing. Picnics were
the order of the day amongst the School children especially. Our youngsters
joined the Sunday School children of St John?s & went off to the Royal Park.
Nurse took the little ones to the same place & so Polly was left all alone with
the baby. Kerferd came with Madeline and stayed to lunch. He afterwards
went with us to the Royal Park to look after the children. Flory Morphy went
as a companion for Madeline. When we got to the Park we had a good look
128 McCulloch was knighted just prior to the formation of his new ministry. The ?dread? of
McCulloch may have dated from the governments suspension of Civil Service pay during
the constitutional crisis of 1865; Stuart Macintyre, A Colonial Liberalism: The Lost
World of Three Victorian Visionaries (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 43.
129 Indicating the way the diary was sometimes written days after the event, Castieau has
written and then crossed out before this last sentence, the words ?Went to the Mechanics
Institute in the evening, read the pap?.


at the birds & animals & then essayed to find the children. The whole Park
seemed full of schools & we visited St Jude?s, St James? & St Mary?s & some
others without finding St John?s so we had much to Madoline & Flory?s
disgust to return without a romp with the little ones. Got home in time for
Kerferd & Madoline to leave by the five o clock Train.
The children made their appearance soon after six o clock, very jolly but very
hungry. They only had such a little for their tea & made up for it with a good-
feed as soon as they got their caps & bonnets off. Sissy had won a race &
brought home as a trophy of her prowess a purse of lollies of which she seemed
very much proud. Polly & I started for the Theatre as we had made up our
minds to see Charles Mathews. 130 There was a great rush for tickets & I had
hard work to get them, however we managed to get into the Stalls & though
rather close to the Bands, our seats were in front & very good ones. However
when we were comfortably settled a cool customer accompanied by a young
woman pushed to the front squeezed her into a seat behind & then popped
himself down on two or three inches of space there was left of my seat which
was an outside one. I did not like to make a row particularly as he had a female
with him, & so his impudence answered his purpose & he remained.
Used Up & The Critic were the pieces played. Mathews is wonderful; it
seems almost impossible he can be the age he states himself to be. It was a
real treat to see him play in either of the pieces. His Sir Fretful Plagiary was
however to my thinking the cleverest piece of acting. The old man?s rage at
the remarks Sneer told him were made in the papers could not be excelled.
April 30 Saturday 1870
The morning very fine indeed, the weather however changed in the
afternoon & a good deal of rain fell. It cleared up again however towards
evening. By The Argus of this morning I saw that Mr Wintle died last
evening. Mrs Castieau left the house at about seven o clock & he must have
breathed his last about three hours after she had gone. I sent for Mrs Gee who
is of course well acquainted with Mrs Wintle & asked her to go down & see
if she could be of any service, she went & returned in the afternoon. Mrs
Wintle had nothing she wished me to do as her son in Law was at the house
& could do everything that was necessary. The funeral is fixed for two o clock
on Monday afternoon. Made up my mind not to muster this afternoon but
to take Polly to Sandridge; it came on however to rain about the time we
started so we had to return back & I went into the Gaol & attended to
muster as usual. In the evening took Polly into Bourke Street & through the
Eastern Market, came home had a smoke & went to bed.
130 Charles Mathews, the actor who toured the colonies in 1870. Castieau had seen him in
England, recalling in 1855 the superior standard of his performances compared to those
on the Melbourne stage (Diary, 10 December 1855). This was an opinion shared in 1870
by the critic Neild for whom Mathews possessed the 'seemingly instinctive faculty of doing
everything at the right time' (Love, James Edward Neild: Victorian Virtuoso , footnote 14, p. 347).

May 1 Sunday 1870
A very nice day. Went to Church with Polly, Harry, Sissy & Dotty. After
dinner went into the Gaol & saw all was correct, then I took Polly & five of
the youngsters to the Cemetary. Godfrey & Walter looked very nice in their
Scotch costume & were very jolly. At the Cemetary we met a Mr Longland
a Clerk at Pentridge, he told us Mr McCulloch had visited Pentridge the day
before but had only occupied an hour in going through the Establishment &
did not seem to care about looking into the working of the place at all. He
was accompanied by Mr Duncan & seemed to want part of Pentridge for an
Industrial School or Reformatory.
Coming home from the Cemetary we met Emma, Agnes & a Miss Parsons
a friend of Agnes. They came to our house & had tea after which I walked to
Emma?s with them, then had a little chat with Joe, took a cab & came to
town & got home about nine o clock. At the Cemetary there was in front of
one of the enclosed Tomb-stones a large marble vase full of very beautiful
flowers. Mr Longland told me they were placed there by a Mr Lazarus in
memory of his wife who has been dead about three years. From the date of
her death till now he has once a week brought fresh flowers to fill the vase.
May 2 Monday 1870
A very fine day. The General Sessions commenced. Not however many Cases.
Received Pay for April. Arranged for Lynch to take a Bill at three months in
payment of his account. In a fuss all day as the Chief Secretary had expressed


his intention of visiting the Gaol & Mr Wintle was to be buried in the
afternoon & I wished to attend his funeral & allow some of the Officers to
do so also. At two o clock as there was no sign of Mr McCulloch I told some
of the old Turnkeys they could go to the funeral & then I took a hansom &
went to meet the procession on the way from Balaklava. Met it on the St
Kilda Road some way past the Turnpike & took my place behind the other
vehicles, went to St Paul?s Church where the coffin was taken out of the
hearse & carried into the Church & then Mr Chase read a psalm & a chapter
of the bible after which the Coffin was carried back to the Hearse. The
procession again formed & proceeded to the Cemetary. On the way I was
asked to be one of the pall-bearers & so of course performed that duty. Mr
Fane walked on the opposite side, Mr Reed, Barnes, Mr G Walsh, Jenkins &
Singleton were the other pall bearers. Came home very cold, had a nobbier
for which Polly bullied me, went out called at Reed?s he asked me to dine
with him at Carton?s [&] I did so. After dinner Reed went to a Council
Meeting & I went & had a look at the new arcade in Bourke Street opened
today, brought some vases for which I paid 17/- & for which I was well
sneered at by Polly when I got home.
May 7 Saturday 1870
A fine day. An Inquest was held upon the body of a child whose mother when
drunk let it fall into the fire. A verdict of Manslaughter against the mother
was returned. Mr Sturt visited the Gaol as Visiting Justice & saw the whole
of the prisoners. In the afternoon after a little pressing by Polly I consented
to take her & the little girls to see Mrs Kerferd. We tried hard to catch the
three o clock train for Hawthorn & arrived at the Station just in time to take
the tickets & to see the train go-away. Mr Wyburn was at the Station &
laughted at our disappointment, however as I was furious over the 1/6 the
Railway tickets had cost Wyburn said they would give the money back at the
office. Polly jumped at the idea & returned with the 1/6 triumphant. I did
not however have much to boast about as in a very practical manner she
pocketed the money instead of returning it to me, its lawful proprietor. We
now determined upon taking a Car to Kew & did so, had a very nice drive
& were put down at Kerferd?s door. The Fare was 3 shillings & very cheap as
Kerferd lives nearly five miles from Melbourne. The Kerferds seemed glad to
see us & the youngsters had a great romp with Madoline. Anderson was at
Kerferd?s when we got there & shortly afterwards Mr Archer the Registrar
General made a call. Archer had a grievance; some paltry reductions having
been made in his department & a hundred struck off his annual income, he
appeared intensely disgusted. Kerferd would insist upon our stopping to tea
& we had to do so consoling ourselves with a capital lobster boiled at home &
which we eagerly devoured. Took a Car for Melbourne at the same charge as that
we paid in the afternoon. Took Sissy & Dotty through the Royal Arcade & then
up & down Bourke Street. Met Miles Garrett Byrne, introduced him to Polly.

Byrne was a little fresh &C Polly did?ent like him. Quarrelled with her for not
showing a little more tact. She would?ent acknowledge her being wrong &so I
got sulky. Took Polly & the youngsters home, then went to the Mechanics. Came
home shortly after nine o?clock.
May 15 Sunday 1870
Weather fine this morning though wet under foot. This is my Birthday
lam forty years old now 131 & must begin to think myself fast sliding into the
middle aged man & losing the right to be considered a young one. As soon
as I awoke Polly wished me many Happy Returns & sealed her wish with
what I am sure was a good honest kiss, as soon as I got down stairs the
youngsters all rushed & overpowered me with their congratulations. Took
Harry Sissy & Dotty to church. In the afternoon Polly was about taking the
children to see Mrs Smith, the girls however insisted on my taking them out
as it was my Birthday so thinking to give them a treat I consented to go with
Polly & Five of the youngsters to Sandridge. Godfrey was very rowdy & it
was with difficulty he could be kept at all right, he shouted the whole way to
Sandridge. When we got there, the Fare was 2/3. The Cabman rather a
cheeky fellow said ?l?ll toss you 2/6 or 21- . I laughing said ?all right?. This
raised the dander of Mrs C & she got very much out of temper & the
pleasure of the afternoon was lost. I got sulky & so we dragged along
disgusted with ourselves & everything around. With a good deal of climbing
got the youngsters on board one of the ships on the pier & with even more
difficulty got them on shore again. Then we saw Fisher, McKinlay & Maggie
Fisher. Maggie looked very charming & I do not wonder at her being a
favorite. Butler will do very well if he gets her consent to be Mrs B & then
131 The birth date (1831) on his marriage certificate must therefore have been incorrect by a year.


does not back away from his offer. Godfrey wanted an awful deal of looking
after & it was quite a relief to get him off the pier safely & the whole party
packed again in a cab for home. Met Harold Stephen & his wife. Harold
wanted some paper for a Plan, had none of the sort he wanted. Went out for a
stroll in the evening. Came back Polly & I both disagreeable, went to bed cross.
Joe & Emma called to-day while we were out.
May 17 Tuesday 1870
Weather fine. In attendance at the Supreme Court. Gave evidence in the
afternoon in the Case of Maria Cox charged with letting her child fall into
the fire. The woman was found guilty of Manslaughter.
Polly went to St Kilda & spent the day at Littlewood?s. Dr McGauran came
from the Court with me when it adjourned in the middle of the day & we
had lunch together. Harry came home this afternoon in a state of great
excitement; he had heard three shots fired, & was asked by a constable where
the shooting was, then he saw a man very excited being taken off in custody.
I thought nothing of it but afterwards learnt that Mr G.P. Smith when going
home from the Supreme Court after defending Maria Cox was shot at by a
barrister named Supple, a writer for the Press. 132 Supple is very near sighted
& missed, he however used a revolver & fired again, running after Smith he
again missed, but fired once more & shot Smith in the elbow. He was about
again to fire when he was rushed by a publican named Walshe who however
fell a victim for Supple fired & shot him in the belly. The case created a great
sensation. Godfrey brought me a carpet bag full of cuttings from Mr Ray?s
garden. If half of them strike I shall have a nice collection. Polly came home
at half past eight with the news that Mrs Telford had only arrived at
Wahgunyah to-day & went across to tell Mrs Morphy. Mr Du Verden
accompanied Polly back & stopped for a time. Went to bed feeling very
seedy. Took fluid magnesia but without any good effect.
Met Neild & Hadden this afternoon. Neild wished me to send some papers
I had written to show as my qualification for my being elected a member of
the Yorick Club as he intended to propose me. 133
June 3 Friday 1870
A fine day, received pay for May & went to the Bank & cashed the cheque.
The turnkeys got their money in the afternoon. Nothing new in the papers.
Counted expenses & found I am spending a great deal more than I can
afford, a lot of money somehow gets dribbled away every month & it seems
hardly possible to be able to save anything with my family & position.

I intended to be strictly
economical this month but
was tempted by the Bill for
this Evening at the Theatre
Royal. Mrs Mathews has
been very highly spoken of
& was to take her Benefit
this evening. The comedy of
London Assurance with Mrs M
as Lady Gay & Mathews as
Dazzle, & then Planches
Burlesque of Medea with of
course Mrs Mathews in the
principal character. Polly was
as eager to go as I was & got
ready in a very short time, we
were at the theatre shortly
after the doors were opened,
there was a great rush & it

was hard work to get tickets, however I managed at last & we found our way
into the Stalls; every seat seemed filled but at length Polly squeezed into a
place & I made up my mind to stand during the evening, however two or
three chairs were brought in & I managed to secure one & place it by the side
of my wife & as things went got on very comfortably. The play was most
enjoyable. Lady Gay was grand & delighted the audience. Old Charley of
course is excellent as Dazzle but he is a little too old for the Part & to my
fancy it is getting beyond him, there is?ent ?Dazzle? enough about the
character as Mathews now (I suppose) has to play it. Rogers played Sir
Harcourt & Greville, Meddle. Ireland was very fair as Young Courtly &
altogether the Piece went smoothly & to the satisfaction of the audience.
Mathews made a speech & said goodbye or rather au revoir to Melbourne.
Medea shows Mrs Mathews powers to great advantage & she liberally gives
the public something more than a glimpse of her natural charms; her dress
was very classic & no doubt appropriate to the character she represented, had
it however been worn on the Stage of the Varieties I guess the Committee of
the Morality Society would have gone & had a look & then groaned over the
depravity of the city which could tolerate such an exhibition.
June 7 Tuesday 1870
Weather dry though cloudy. Received a letter from the Bank this morning
telling me the Draft I paid in yesterday had been dishonoured, it seems it
was sent to Tohn Castieau & I endorsed it J.B. Castieau. Went to the bank &
wrote ?John? so I suppose it will now be all right. Met Steel while I was out.


Joe came to lunch & after him Dotty & Miss Sturgess. Polly went with Dotty
& Miss Sturgess to see Mrs Dickson. After Muster I went into town met Mr
Nolan the Solicitor along with Aspinall & a friend, went with them to the Port
Philip. In the evening had a game of romps with the little girls, then Polly
went over to Mrs Morphy?s & I smoked the time away till just before she came
in. When she arrived I was on the sofa asleep. Polly came home this afternoon
with a fresh grievance of Harriette?s; it appears that Harriette has been talking
to Dotty about the improriety of Polly sitting in the Stalls when she goes to
the Theatre & also has been surprised that she should go with Lodging House
Keepers. She went one evening with Mrs Morphy & her daughters. Dotty told
Harriette that Mrs Morphy was a lady & received into the best company
Melbourne could produce but Harriette repeated, still you know she is a
lodging house keeper. Poor Harriette, 1 think she must be getting a little daft,
she is evidently very cross with me & consequently with Polly.
June 8 Wednesday 1870
The weather tolerably fine. Went to the Sheriff?s office in the morning & did
a very foolish thing; I wanted a good lock for the Armoury & sent for one.
The contractor charged �2.5. It certainly was a very good one but too
expensive, however instead of sending it back I kept it & the Sheriff very
properly remonstrated with me for ordering anything without first
ascertaining the cost. Dotty called this morning & left little Nelly who stayed
the night with the youngsters. After muster went into town, felt very seedy
& I went into an hotel opposite the Argus [office] for a little brandy, this will
cause Polly to ?swear? but I beg to add tis not my custom. Went to the
Mechanics & read the papers, saw in The Ovens and Murray that Kerferd in
his letter stated every one connected with the Beechworth Gaol was more or
less censured in the Report excepting Gibson & that there would probably
be dismissals & removals. Brett would be awfully wild, as the writer went on
to say, ?what a pity it was the management had deteriated since the removal
of Mr Castieau as the Gaol had then the reputation of being a model one?.
I am sorry my name was mentioned. It will make Brett nasty & Stewart
spiteful however I do not know why I should need to care about them.
June 12 Sunday 1870
The weather still inclined to be very changeable. Had a litde barney with Polly
about church, I being inclined to attend the Gaol Service & Polly wishing me to
go with her & Harry to St Johns. I got cross but however though I had the best
of the argument. I went to St lohns. It was Sacrament Sunday. Mr Barlow
preached an eloquent sermon & most affectionately pressed his congregation to
attend the Sacrament, very few however responded to the invitation & I for one
felt ashamed at leaving the church without doing so. There seems very litde real
sincerity in Christians of the present day & most of us must be in a bad way if
what we are taught & profess to believe is the Truth. Polly & the youngsters went


�. V
? M
to Aunty Emmas this afternoon & there had their tea, between six & seven they
returned bringing Uncle & Aunt with them, nothing new with Joe & Emma,
they seem getting along very comfortable & will I hope know yet many happy
days together. After our visitors had left I went into town for a walk, took a
solitary stroll through Bourke & Collins Streets & then returned about nine o
clock; by the by I forgot to mention just before I went out all the Gas was
suddenly extinguished & the House was left in darkness. Upon going to enquire
the cause 1 found that Turnkey Magree had muffishly turned a wrong tap & so
shut the gas off which caused the sensation. In The Australasian of yesterday ?The
Peripatetic? announced his last article, having as he said sold his office of Free
Speech for a mess of official Porridge; in other words Marcus Clarke the
Peripatetic has been appointed Secretary to the Library Commissioners. The
Australasian will miss the EEs column. 134
June 24 Friday 1870
Weather tolerably fine though at times
threatening. Attended at the Sheriff?s office &
talked to him about the sentence of Taylor.
When Judge Barry 135 was sentencing Taylor he
made the remark that he should consider a
sentence of two years imprisonment was
equivalent to one of eight years on the Roads,
it is hard to arrive at any conclusion as to
[crossed out] the manner in which Judge
Barry reached this conclusion, but as I said to
the Sheriff I fancy if the Judge had to undergo
either of the sentences he would take the two
years imprisonment in preference.
As far as my experience teaches, a sentence
of imprisonment is practically far less severe
than one of Labor on the Roads. A prisoner
sentenced to Imprisonment only, can not be put
to severe labor or to any labor at all if he is
allowed to supply himself with food which he

June 25 Saturday 1870
Weather fine. Felt rather seedy this morning, however was not very bad, saw
Mr Smyth the Crown Prosecutor & took a walk with him as far as Menzies
hotel. Went in with him & had a nobbier then walked home in time for
lunch. After lunch was rather so so & said I should lie down for a time when
to my astonishment Polly wanted to lie down as well so we all made up our
minds to be lazy & went to-bed. I managed to get up just late enough to
escape the Muster, however I went in & enquired if all was right & so felt
tolerably satisfied.
Went to the Mechanics in the evening & read the papers. Mr Gordon a
well known sporting man & a poet of some pretensions blew his brains out
yesterday. 136 This suicide has created much sensation. Mr Walstab brother of
the novelist of that name was also found drowned; it is not known how he
got into the water. To day a clerk in the Education office, a Mr Nicholls, was
killed while following the Melbourne hounds. There has been certainly
plenty of sensation since it was commenced by the attempt at murder of G.P.
Smith. Polly took Maggie over to Morphys & they were not home when I got
back however they came before nine o clock with Mr Seddon & then Polly
& Maggie went with Seddon & myself into Bourke Street. We did Paddy?s
Market at one end of the street & the Arcade at the other, the evening was
pleasant & the walk I think did us all good. When we got home Seddon
would not venture in & so we soon all got to bed women as well as myself
being tolerably well tired out.
Felt billious so to be safe took some cockles. 137
June 28 Tuesday 1870
The weather was fine to day & I had two parties of men busy engaged
weeding & carting away from the plots in front of the Gaol. Did very little
myself all day. Dotty & Miss Skinner a friend of her[s] had dinner with us &
so had Joe Lotherington. After Muster I went to the Mechanics & read the
Papers. After tea I spent an hour or two with the children & when they went
to bed settled down to my pipe & grog. Polly & I were squabbling about
nothing as usual when Mr Seddon called & said he came for her to give Mr
Duerdin a dancing lesson. Polly pressed me to go with her but I would not
& she went but was back before eleven o clock. While she was away Mr Stark
called for the Calendar, it was however too soon & he did not get it.
When Polly came back she was very jolly & wanted to be friendly. I had
however a fit of the blues & could be nothing but disagreeable. I did not go
to bed for some time & when I did showed very bad temper. I certainly am

getting very queer & at times am inclined to 'give up . I ought to be as jolly as
most men, with a good billet & a healthy wife & children; somehow or other
what should be pleasant turns out dust & ashes & all I long for as soon as it is
got proves a mistake & is soon considered valueless. 'I suppose it is liver.?
July 11 Monday 1870
The weather dry but very cold. Transplanted some cypresses that were in front
of the House & gave it rather a funereal appearance. Polly was very busy
superintending their departure. Had a party of prisoners employed in
colouring the nursery. Went into town this morning & met Gill of ?The
Portia?. He assured me my Shares would be all right & that there should be no
Calls made upon them, he promised at the next meeting of the Directors to
get a Minute to that effect entered upon the Books of the Company. Mr Avent
the Resident Surgeon of the Lying In Hospital called in the afternoon & 1
introduced him to Polly. Avent is a member of the Yorick Club. After Muster
I went to the Yorick Club & said ?how do you do? to a few of the members
who were present. Ogier was playing Bezique with Mr McKinlay the Law
Reporter of The Argus & four or five other men were reading the Papers.
Rawlings showed me through the Place which is comfortable but certainly
not pretentious, it is open from nine A.M till 2 A M so that the members
have always got a comfortable place to go to & read, write or chat as
disposition or opportunity invites them.


After tea Polly went over the way to Morphy?s. It being Mrs Tetley?s Birthday a
little dancing was going on, she stayed away till a little after ten o clock. I stayed
at Home. Read a little, drank a little & smoked a good deal.
July 15 Friday 1870
Weather still fine though looking likely to change. The Supreme Court
Sittings commenced this morning & I was very busy at the Court &
elsewhere all the day. Went to the Yorick Club in the evening & skimmed the
papers. Parliament was prorogued to-day. Mr Swallow came up to take
Maggie, he very kindly invited the whole family to come to Sandridge & visit
his manufactory. 138 He stated he had between eighty & ninety people
employed in making biscuits by machinery & I found he had learnt his
business at Huntley & Palmer?s the great Reading House & that all the
biscuits at one time so largely imported into the Colony are now made by
himself & other local men. He is protected by a duty of a penny a pound
which is charged on the imported article but said he did not wish it as he
could compete with free trade. I expressed the pleasure I should feel in
visiting his works & he asked me to bring all the children. Mrs Castieau said
they will eat all your biscuits at which he laughed & said ?let them, I always
fill people?s pockets & sometimes their umbrellas?. In the evening Mr Seddon
came across &C invited us to go to the opera with him; we agreed that he
should accompany us to the Princesses to-morrow night & that we should go
with him to the Royal on Monday. Lucy Morphy and Miss McDermott
were at our house in the evening. After they were gone I laid down on the
sofa & slept till past midnight, then I went into the Gaol & caught one
of the Turnkeys napping, after that I joined Polly who had been in bed for
some time.
July 20 Wednesday 1870
Weather fine again. Got up with rather a headache, however made the best
of it & got into Court in good time. The case of Supple was tried to day &
occupied the whole of it. Mr Higinbotham assisted by Mr Dobson appeared
for the prisoner & Mr Dunn the Crown Prosecutor was assisted by Mr
Williams the son of Judge Williams. Mr Higinbotham spoke for two hours
& made a most effective address endeavouring to convince the Jury Supple
was insane & quite unaccountable for his actions. A large number of
Witnesses were called for the Defence & proved the prisoner had been very
eccentric in his conduct. The Judge summed up & laid down the Law, that
if the prisoner knew when he attacked Smith he was offending against the
law he was accountable for his acts. He requested the Jury if they found the
prisoner guilty to state whether the pistol went off by accident or not.
138 Thomas Swallow (1827-1890), founder of the Swallow and Ariell biscuit company
(Australian Dictionary of Biography).


A verdict of Guilty was returned & the Jury added that in their opinion the
pistol was discharged by accident. The Chief Justice who presided then
reserved the Point for the consideration of the full bench as to whether the
offence amounted to Murder or Manslaughter.
The Jury retired about ten o clock & did not bring in their verdict till past
midnight. I was very unwell during the day & was very tired before it was
over. I was in the Court for more than fourteen hours. Told to-day that the
reason Mr Aspinall did not assist in the defence of Supple was that he had
just become Insolvent & filed his Schedule.
July 21 Thursday 1870
A tolerably fine day. Maggie Fisher went back to Sandridge this afternoon.
I was in Court the whole of the morning & got away about three o clock.
Draper was brought up for Sentence & received three years in addition to
previous sentence. Patrick Smith for Murder was sentenced to Death without
hope of mercy & a number of other minor offenders received hot sentences
from the Chief Justice who was particularly caustic in his remarks to
a fraudulent Insolvent to whom he gave three years on the Roads. Received
a letter from Harriette asking me if I could get her a Ticket for the Concert at
the opening of the Town Hall. I must reply in the negative; I would not ask
for myself & should not like to do so for anyone else. After Muster went to
the Yorick Club & peeped at the papers, came home to dinner, Polly had got
some jugged hare which was reported to her to be particularly nice but which
was I am inclined to believe uncommonly nasty. After tea Polly who is full of
the Fancy Dress Ball started away to consult her friend Mrs Smith & came
back fully impressed with the belief that she had an ?idea? & would come out
strong at little expense. 1 am to be made into something operatic, ?Elvino?.
I believe particularly appropriate as I do not know a note of music & could?ent
sing Pop goes the Weasel in tune if twere to save my life, however who?ll care
if I dont (& my legs dont look ridiculous in Trick [?] hose).
July 22 Friday 1870
A wet disagreeable day, hardly remember how I was engaged during the day.
Was at the Sheriff?s Office but was told he was not coming to town to day.
Went to the Mechanics after muster & got a book. Mr Sturt the Visiting
Justice kept me engaged till close upon Muster time, received a Ticket of
Invitation for Saturday to attend the Laying the Foundation Stone of The
Australian Wine & Distillery Company. Joe Thompson the betting man &
the Proprieter of the Continental Cafe came up this afternoon to see a woman
who in revenge for not being allowed inside the Cafe took up a stone &
smashed one of the large plate glass windows of the establishment; it seems
that females are not allowed inside the cafe but that the waitresses who are
dressed in fancy costumes are not any better than they should be &
consequently the outsiders have a down upon them & their place of business


which of course is frequented by most of the loose fish of Melbourne.
Thompson is afraid the woman I spoke about will smash his windows again
if she is released from prison & he visited her in the hope of inducing her to
go to New Zealand where she has friends. Polly went to have a chat at Mrs
Morphy?s, Lucy was here this morning, of course there is nothing talked of or
thought about but the Fancy Dress Ball which is creating a sensation
somewhat terrific in its character.
July 29 Friday 1870
A tolerably fine day, though the evening was cloudy. Saw the Sheriff who told
me the Chief Secretary was wild because Draper was employed as a clerk
instead of breaking stones or [doing] even more degrading work. On the same
principal I imagine Tradesmen should not be allowed to work at their trades
but should be used as ordinary laborers. A funny theory this just at this time
when the Press of the Colony is crying out about the necessity of making
prison labor remunerative. Draper as a stone-breaker would be of little service
as a clerk. He can & has already well earned his subsistence in Gaol.
July 30 Saturday 1870
It was a wet disagreeable day, as might be expected. After a time this morning
I felt rather seedy & not much inclined for work, however I went cheerfully at
it & had to begin with a long interview with the Sheriff & considerable talk
about my requisitions. The Sheriff is getting very particular & ?screws? wherever
he sees, or fancies he sees, an opportunity. Was told the Chief Secretary was
very indignant that Draper should be employed as a Clerk & not set to work
to break stones like the general run of prisoners set to hard labor. Robbing a
Bank, in the eyes of the Bank Director, was one of the most audacious of crimes
& deserving of even exceptional punishment. After dinner when I had seen all
was correct I went to bed with Polly & there we remained for a couple of hours
& arose much refreshed. Mr Brown & Miss Morphy came over & I paid
Brown 3/6 for my share of the cab to St Kilda. Brown wanted Polly to go to
the Opera this evening but she felt too tired & did not venture. It was a wet
night so I purchased the three weeklys & stayed at home & read them. Lucy
Morphy brought some camelia cuttings & I intend to stick them into the
ground & let them take their chance of striking. Amateur florists seem divided
in opinion as to whether camelias can be raised from cuttings, most of them
are however against the chance of them being so grown. I can however but try.
August 15 Monday 1870
The weather fine to-day. Polly started to look for a Nurse in place of ours who
has made up her mind it is necessary for her to give up working for a time, we
are sorry for she has behaved well to us. I am sure the youngsters & all of us
will be very sorry to lose her. Was shocked to see by The Argus this morning
that Mr Fade was dangerously ill & on enquiring at the office I found it was


too true. The officers in the Department seem really grieved & I am sure I feel
very very sorry & if we lose Mr Farie shall feel I have lost my best friend.
August 17 Wednesday 1870
The morning was fine though bitterly cold. The news from Pentridge was
very bad indeed. Mr Farie was not expected to live & given over it was said
by the medical men. There was much putting of heads together & many
ominous shakes of the head amongst the officers of the Department all of
whom are very much attached to the Sheriff & dislike the idea of having
another Chief. This evening about eight o clock a change came over Mr Farie
& I am glad to hear there is still a chance of his recovery.
Got into a bad temper this afternoon with Polly. I had got a little out of
sorts with hearing the bad news about Mr Farie & took a nobbier at dinner
instead of beer, consequently I wanted another at tea time. This Polly
objected to & would?ent give me the keys till I got into a bad temper &
insisted on having them. It was very foolish of me because Polly was only
doing what she believed was for my good. Did Harry?s sums for him.
August 22 Monday 1870
Weather fine, woke up this morning with my foot very troublesome indeed,
about ten o clock heard that poor Mr Farie had died this morning a little after
eight o clock. Went to the Sheriff?s office, much sorrow among the officers,
not unmixed with some speculation as to who would be the new Sheriff. Ellis
is to act till the appointment is made. Edwards & Whiteman came this
afternoon. Edwards sent for Mrs Edwards. Began drinking Brandy in the
middle of the day & found it did me no good. In the evening had a skirmish
with Polly & got very bad tempered. The Messenger from the Chief
Secretary?s office called with a letter announcing the time fixed for the
Execution of James Cusack; went to the prisoner & read him the letter. Sent
a telegram to Brett to tell him of Mr Farie?s death, received one from him in
return marked ?Confidential? asking me to advise him how best to use his
interest in Melbourne, told him in answer Mr Michie was Head of
Department & held his own. I suppose Brett thinks there is a chance of his
being appointed Sheriff ofVictoria. I am sure however he is much misktaken,
the late affair at Beechworth Gaol has not done him any good & it is not at
all likely he will receive any promotion for some time.
August 23 Tuesday 1870
Very unwell indeed this morning, head bad, foot worse & altogether out of
sorts, did not get up till late but took some pills the first thing in the morning
& an emetic an hour or two afterwards. Went to the Sheriff?s office. Ellis
informed me he was Sheriff for the time being. The time for the Funeral of
Mr Farie has not yet been fixed. In the afternoon The Penal Commissioners


visited the Gaol. 139 The Chief Justice was at their head. The Commissioners
went through the Gaol & seemed struck with the extent of it. I pointed out
the absence of any work excepting Stone-breaking & that a number of men
sentenced to Imprisonment were idle in consequence. The Commissioners
then came into the House to see the pictures Law copied; they seemed much
struck with the ability shown by him. 140 After tea went into town & called at
the Yorick & also at the Mechanics where I changed book for Polly. Got
home by eight o clock, Polly away, she returned at ten o clock & had been to
see Mrs Smith at North Melbourne. Joe called this afternoon, did?ent get a
chance of speaking to him as he hooked it as soon as I came in with the Chief
Justice & the rest. Polly very busy designing a Yard for the rearing of poultry;
last year during a long season she managed to obtain very few chickens in
comparison with the number of eggs she sat, she hopes to do better this time.
August 29th Monday 1870
My foot still troubling me, went on taking the Rheumatic Mixture as
directed. A fine day, went to the Sheriff?s Office. A Return called for by the
Penal Commission sent to the Sheriff, but which of course I am expected to
fill up, at the bottom are some questions calling for answers from practical
experience. These Ellis wishes me to fill up so that he may suck my brains I
suppose for his own benefit, do not feel at all inclined to give him the chance
however if I can help it.
Much excitement about the War, 141 many people being afraid England may
be dragged into it & consequently the tranquility of the Colony be disturbed.
I mustered this evening & saw Cusick who is to die to-morrow. His children
were brought to see him from the Industrial School & took their last look in
this world of their wretched father. Lucy Morphy came over to see us, she was
talking to Mrs Castieau about Whyburn but does not seem at all in a hurry to
become Mrs W. She says she does not yet know enough of her beau & then
you see he is ?old?. Forty, I should think. Why says Polly, I thought he was
about the same age as Castieau, by the by, Castieau was 40 in May last,
however to a good wife I suppose a husband always appears youthful.
This evening I went to the Mechanics & then looked in at the Yorick Club.
War talk bought some tobacco, more War Talk, came home & talked War
again till time to go to bed.
August 30 Tuesday 1870
A fine day. My foot rather better though still troublesome. Received a letter
from my father, also one for Edwin Smith from his mother which I at once
139 The Royal Commission on Penal and Prison Discipline, whose three reports (1871-72)
mapped out the influence of mid-century ideas about crime, delinquency and prison
reform. See Mark Finnane, Punishment in Australian Society (Melbourne, 1997), pp. 48-49.
140 Castieau had supplied materials for a prisoner, Law, whose drawings are referred to here.
141 The Franco-Prussian War of 1870.


forwarded. My father wrote very strongly with regard to the Acts of the
English Government; he takes a very gloomy view of Home matters &
predicts the fall of the Empire. I suppose however he was a little bilious at the
time he wrote his letter.
The old gentleman gave me some capital advice particularly with regard to
what is called ?keeping up appearances?; he stated very truly that if we lived
beyond our means we should only be able to do so for a short time & should
afterwards be sneered at for having been so foolish. This was the morning
fixed for the Execution of James Cusick, sentenced to Death for the Murder
of his wife at Gooley?s Creek. At Ten o clock I accompanied Mr Ellis to the
Cell & handed over Cusick to the tender charge of Bamford. When the Drop
fell Cusick hung motionless for a moment but then his breast began to heave
& he appeared to live for two or three minutes; he held all the time a
handkerchief which he had in his hand when the bolt was drawn. When the
body was cut down I examined the neck as I could not understand why there
was so much muscular movement & I found that part of Cusick?s flannel
shirt had been between the rope & the neck. This I imagine must have
prevented the rope from getting quite close to the other portion of the neck
& perhaps delayed immediate strangulation. I have no doubt the fall
dislocated the neck. Cusick was a powerfully built man of about fourteen
stone weight. An Inquest was afterwards held by Dr Youl & the usual verdict
returned. After muster this evening I went into Melbourne & called at the
Yorick Club. There I met McKinley & Wheeler & was induced to play a
game of three handed cribbage with them. I managed to lose four shillings.
This however is the first money I have lost at cards since I have been in
Melbourne & I do not think I shall make a practice of playing & if so, I have
not done much harm. Stayed at home all the evening.
September 5 Monday 1870
The dust was very disagreeable to-day, went into town in the morning, met
Gill & talked to him about ?The Portia?, do not like the appearance of things
in connection with the Company. Gill stated, the Jumping Case was not
heard at the last Court but was postponed till October; he said the Jumpers
& the Portia men were working in a shaft together & that a Receiver had
been appointed to take the gold if any was obtained. Gill persisted there was
no liability on my Shares & promised to get it marked on the Scrip after
Wednesday. I wanted to go to the office, but he said the new manager had
not yet got the Books but would have them on Wednesday. I again pointed
out, that the name of the Company ought to be painted up at the office &
Gill said he spoke to the manager about it & he promised to get it done.
I do not believe a penny piece in the genuineness of this company. In the
afternoon Seddon sent me a note & a Loan Proposal from the Alliance
Company. It will cost me between eight & ten pounds a year to insure my


life for �250 a year. The Company would lend me �123 which I could pay
back in 12 quarterly Instalments. The Cost the first year would be �63.4 if
my Life was taken at Par. To borrow the money I must however have three
Sureties & the question is who to ask to become them. Polly went for a walk
with me & I did not muster, went to the Mechanics & Polly went to Mrs
Smith?s in the evening. Sent in my answers to the Penal Commission; Ellis
said he would send them as they were given to him.
September 7 Wednesday 1870
Steady rain the whole of the day. No work doing & nothing but dullness
indoors & out. Went to the Sheriff?s office after I had got through ordinary
morning business & scribbled the usual page in my Diary, still wondering
how I shall get the money I require, have not asked any one to become
Surety for me & would in fact rather pay heavy Interest than do so. Received
some time since a Circular from one Waxman a money lender offering
accommodation. Thought of writing to him & did so but unfortunately the
Circular has been destroyed & I do not know the address so I could not send
the letter. I wrote a letter to Gibson yesterday & asked him to send
Thompson back his revolver. Brown a Detective who was reported by me for
giving a prisoner tobacco & who was suspended in consequence was I was
glad to see reinstated to-day as he bears an excellent character in the Force.
I should not have liked him to have been dismissed but was glad he has had
a severe caution.
Had a few words with Polly which arose out of some talk about money.
I told Polly she had better go away for a month or so till I had arranged my
difficulties. She fired up at this & I foolishly said ?she was a fair-weather
wife? though I did?ent mean it & have no cause for saying so, it however
made her very cross & we were not very loving for the rest of the evening.
After tea helped Harry to do his sums then went to the Mechanics & looked
in at the Yorick the latter place was however deserted, came home & went
to bed early.
September 8 Thursday 1870
A terribly wet day, the rain fell in sheets & the whole country is more or less
flooded. Great disasters Up Country. The trains on the Echuca line could not
run & there is at the present time much fear that the Malmsbury Reservoir
will not stand the heavy pressure of water; if it bursts great damage will
be occasioned.
Attended the Supreme Court & heard the Argument before the
Judges with regard to Supple?s Case, whether he was guilty of ?Murder? or
?Manslaughter?. Messrs Higinbotham & Dobson appeared for Supple, Messrs
Dunn & Williams for the Crown. Judgement was reserved. Harry came
home from school in the middle of the day drenched, he had waded through


some deep water & thought it fine fun at first no doubt, he got tired of it
however & was crying when he got home. I was savage & growled like an old
fool as I suppose I am.
Mustered & as the weather had taken up intended going out for a stroll,
found Cuthbert however at my Quarters so purchased a lobster & stayed at
home that he might get his tea. Went to the Mechanics & then to The Yorick
in the evening. Paid 2/6 for a chance in a raffle for a Portfolio of Lithographs
of Guerrard?s Australian Scenery, 142 they belong to Shillinglaw 143 who wants to
dispose of it before he leaves Melbourne. I expect he is rather hard up just now.
Heard this evening that Croydon won the Sydney Metropolitan so there?s
an end of my chance in Ellis?s double & I must cash up my �2.10 to settle.
Heard Rawlings had been called to account by the Royal Society whose
Treasurer he was for some time.
September 9 Friday 1870
The weather was reasonably dry to-day though it did not pass without a
heavy squall with rain a little after one o clock, was busy in the Gaol this
morning having a good deal of one thing & another to do. Dr Youl came &
corrected a warrant which he had given for Elton charged last week with
Murder. Went to the Sheriff?s Office & told Ellis he could have my half of
the double when he wanted to settle with the book-maker. Polly went to St
Kilda in the afternoon & had tea with Mrs Littlewood.
Wrote a letter to my father this afternoon & after tea Harry got his pencil
& wrote a letter on his slate for his Grandfather, afterwards he copied it on a
sheet of paper. For a nine year old Harry did very well, he spells wonderfully
well for so young a lad & has got a little idea of composition, he writes
however a fearful scrawl principally because he will not take time, but writes
or rather scribbles away as if he had exhausted the art years ago & could now
afford to be careless or rather reckless.
After Harry had finished his letter I went into Melbourne & called at the
Yorick Club, there I had a long chat & did not get away till past ten o clock.
Shillinglaw, Semple, a reporter late from The Argus & one or two others were
there & we chatted away in very friendly style. There is a nasty scandal about
Rawlings who has for a long time regularly sat on the City Bench as a
Magistrate & whose constant attendance has been more than once
commented upon. I always thought Rawlings was waiting in expectation of
being made a PM. While the grass grows the steed starves & Rawlings has
142 Eugene von Guerard (1812-1901) joined the gold rush from London in 1852. He
painted widely in Victoria and New South Wales, particularly in the Southern Alps, and
was Curator and Master of the National Gallery of Victorias Art School from 1870 to 1882.

Service (.Australian Dictionary of Biography) .


been hard up. He was & is Hon. Treasurer to the Royal Society & lately there
has been a cry out from the members for him to settle. This he has not done
& the circumstance appeared in one of the papers. Rawlings sat on the Bench
as usual & The Argus commented on the bad taste he displayed in so doing.
Yesterday the poor fellow was picked up in the Botanical Gardens
apparently suffering from strychnine, he was conveyed to the Hospital where
he lies dangerously ill. He denies having taken the poison but says he had
some strychnine in his pocket which he had purchased to destroy vermin &
some of which might have got mixed up with some biscuits which he had
eaten, poor fellow. This story does not seem one that can easily be credited.
September 15 Thursday 1870
A very windy dusty day. This morning a prisoner got through the rubble
shoot of the Labor Yard into the Road where however he was captured by the
Turnkey there in charge of prisoners. 1 had the prisoner brought before the
Visiting Justice & he was sentenced to two months additional labor in Irons.
The Supreme Court Sittings commenced this morning; Supple was brought
up for Sentence. Supple made a very telling Speech & gave a little homily on
the prevalence of slander in this Colony & the evils arising from it. He spoke
very calmly & collectedly & expressed his anxiety to leave this Country &
that he should be glad to do so even through the Gate of Death. In the course
of his address Supple hit very hard at George Baton Smith & at the Press. The
Chief Justice sentenced Supple to Death in the usual manner. In
consideration of Supple?s blindness I led him out of Court, then he was taken
to the Gaol. Dressed in Prison clothing & Ironed, all through he seemed to
display the exultation of a martyr glorious in suffering for a good cause.
Received a sheet of Queries for myself & all the officers to fill for the Civil
Service Commissioners information. After Muster went into town & had a
look in at the Yorick Club then came home to tea. After tea, smoked for a
time then went into the office & amused myself in writing answers to the
Queries, wrote however a great deal too much & suppose my amusement will
not prove profitable employment. Polly went over to Mrs Robertsons.
Supple?s address this morning made a great impression on many who heard
it; his remarks with regard to his quarrel with G.P. Smith will have weight
with the Irish Party who will believe Supples statement that Smith
pertinaciously slandered his countrymen. I do not think G.P. will receive
many Irish votes at the next election.
September 20 Tuesday 1870
A very fine day. Got up very unrefreshed, not having passed by any means a
good night. Nathan came up this morning. I asked him for the money. I
wanted �l2O, he without hesitation agreed to let me have it but charged me
�3O for it. I am to pay the �l5O in six bills of �25 each payable one each three


months. I handed over my Life Policy to Nathan as Security. Went into Town
& paid all the Accounts I could manage. Paid Milton the Tailor, Robertson
& Moffatt, Drapers, Cameron Baker, Allford Butcher, Alston & Brown
Drapers, Carter, Wine Merchant, Smythers Ditto, Martin Milk-man &
Gemmell Auctioneer. Made out cheques for the other Tradesmen I owe
anything to & find my �l2O will only just make me free from the risk of
being dunned.
The Californian Mail arrived at Sydney this day & brought four days later
news from Europe. The excitement was very great in town & when The Argus
Extraordinary came out it was rushed. The boys selling it reaped a fine harvest
easily getting a shilling each for the copies they had secured from the office.
The Prussians were jubilant as the news brought was to the effect that the
French had met with fearful reverses & that the Emperor was being called
upon to abdicate. The French profess not to believe the news to be true. They
say, wait till the English Mail comes in then we shall see. Certainly the news
brought professes to be only four days later than the last received & if it is true
events must have followed upon each other in very rapid succession. Two
gentlemen from Western Australia visited the Gaol this afternoon. I went
through with them. Did not muster this afternoon, called at the Yorick,
nothing talked of but the news of the War. In the evening went to the
Mechanics & to the Yorick, at the latter place had a long chat with Drs Colbee
& Black. Mrs Robertson spent most of the day at our house helping Polly to
make marmalade.
September 29 Thursday 1870
To day the Executive decided the Case of Supple, he is to be hanged on the
10 th of October. Supple was very cool when I told him of the decision of the
Executive & seemed glad the suspense was over. I went to see him at Ten o
clock this evening, he was cheerful & expressed himself satisfied with the
result. He thanked God though not given much to protest, he had always felt
as a Christian. He was about to die an honorable death & the gallows would
bring no disgrace upon him or his. He acknowledged such deeds as his would
not be right as a rule but he considered his case to be a most exceptional one
& would not for a moment consider but that he had acted for the best, he
had considered the matter well & was prepared for the consequences. Supple
ridiculed the theory of Dr Wooldridge, that he Supple was morally insane &
told me all his knowledge of the doctor which certainly if Supple?s statement
be correct is not much to the credit of the doctor. I was at the Yorick Club
this afternoon & played several games of Cribbage with McKinlay &
Wheeler. In the evening I went to the Mechanics & to the Yorick. Polly spent
the evening at Mrs Morphy?s. Butler was there & came home with Polly had
a chat & then he went away & we went to bed.


October 2 Sunday 1870
A very fine day. My cold was very much worse & seems likely to give me a
good deal of trouble. It is more like influenza to-day & I find my head aches
& I am altogether unwell.
Polly took Walter & Godfrey to church. Harry did not go & I did not either
as I was unwell. After Muster in the afternoon I went to Sandridge & had a
walk on the Pier. There were some very fine ships at the Pier & a goodly crowd
of people looking at them as the weather was fine. Got home to tea at a little
past six o clock. Emma had tea with us & after tea Joe came to take her home,
was sorry to hear Agnes was suffering from a bad foot. During the day I read
the War Supplement of The Australasian & made myself tolerably conversant
with the particulars of the war so far as it has proceeded. Read also another
portion of Lothai d 44 must confess with less pleasure than I felt in perusing
some of the previous chapters. The part I read to-day related exclusively to the
Wiles of the Roman Catholic Clergy in their strenuous efforts to ensnare
Lothair in their toils & win him &L his money over to the Church. It did not
seem natural to me [that] High Dignitaries of the Church within a step of the
Pope himself would have condescended to plot as they are represented to Plot,
nor that any one in his senses could have been imposed upon & made act so
foolishly as Lothair is represented to have acted.
October 7 Friday 1870
A very wet day, did not clear up at all till the evening. Still very quiet in the
house & particularly uncommunicative. Polly likewise. Much excitement
about Supple?s Case. The efforts of his friends proved successful in obtaining
a reprieve on the ground that an appeal might be made to the Privy Council
as to the legality of his conviction.
Mr Ellis the acting Sheriff informed Supple of the reprieve & he (Supple)
seemed very pleased & expressed himself thankful for the sake of his sisters
& for himself also, for, said he ?as a matter of taste, I prefer not being hanged?.
In the evening I went to The Yorick & had a chat with Mr Semple about
Supple. I like Semple very much & he appears to take to me very well. He
has worked very hard for Supple & is of course highly pleased with the result.
Paid a butter bill to-day, cannot escape from great expense & shall find it
very hard to manage with the salary I shall have left after paying the
Quarterly Bills which I have undertaken to meet. There is always something
wanting & money has to be found for necessaries or things which if not
necessaries have come to be considered as such by persons in our position.
October 8 Saturday 1870
The weather very fine indeed to day. Purchased four lbs of Grass Seed &
sowed bare patches in the Croquet Ground. Went into Melbourne this
144 Lothair , a novel by Benjamin Disraeli (1870).


morning but did not meet any one I cared about sufficiently to stop & talk
to. Met Nathan who on the strength of being my creditor stopped me & held
out his hand while making some enquiry regarding Supple. Mrs Zipak?s
mother called upon Polly this afternoon; a gentleman was with her. Mr &
Mrs Eaton also made a Call upon Polly. Heard this afternoon that ?The
Portia Mining Company gained the Case against the Jumpers with �52 costs,
word was sent by Gill not to part with any shares. ?Just my luck? as Graves
would say for a few days ago, as I have entered in my Diary, I gave over my
interest to Gill for an 1.0. U. of �10.5/. It is at any rate better for the
Company to have won as I suppose now I ought to be safe from any chance
of having to pay Costs. The only thing is that I am afraid 1 parted with my
Shares without saving myself from risk & that I might just as well have kept
them & waited the result. I suppose Gill will at any rate now give me the
amount of the 1.0.U & that will be more than I ever expected to see again
from my shares in the Company. I shall be curious to see if the Shares become
valuable how Cuthbert will act. He kept aloof & would not pay any expenses
or have anything to do with the Company, however I suppose now he will
urge his claim for the Shares that were gazetted in his name.
Did not muster this afternoon, went to the Yorick & stayed there for some
time, made a stupid mistake in pronouncing the word cynicism, pronounced
it Cynick-ism & saw the mistake was taken particular notice of. Supple
pronounced it in this manner & I took it for granted he was correct &
followed his expression.
Went to the Mechanics in the evening & changed some books, came
home & read. Polly & Harry went into Bourke Street together. I came
home in the Dumps & remained in them till I went to bed which I did
between ten & eleven.
October 26 Wednesday 1870
Weather fine to-day quite cold however & with every appearance of change.
Attended at the Criminal Court to-day; some bail cases were being tried.
Received English newspapers for Edwin Smith, forwarded his letters to him.
Read a great deal of the War news & was truly disgusted at the horrible things
that have been enacted. It is beyond my powers to conceive the orginators of
the Wholesale murders coolly watching through glasses at a distance, where
their own carcasses were in safety, the slaughter of the thousands of their
victims who fell in obedience to their commands. The pictures drawn of the
appearance of the wounded & dead were vivid & sufficient to cause the most
callous to shudder, yet the Crown Prince of Prussia, Bismarck, General
Sheridan & a favored few watched the battle most complacently & looked
for something to drink after the bloody work was over with as much
complacency as if they had been viewing a Play or an Opera. The sight of the
Emperor of France a prisoner overwhelmed the king of Prussia (though the


Emperor took things tolerably coolly) & making him comfortable seems to
have been considered of far more importance than the looking after the
wounded or the protecting the Peasants of the neighbourhood from murder
or robbery. Went to the Yorick in the evening & stayed there for some time
reading the last number of Edwin Drood 145 & some English Papers.
October 27 Thursday 1870
Wet nearly the whole of the day. Attended at the Court. This was the day fixed
for the trial of Supple for shooting at G.P. Smith; the Court was crowded with
professional men & others anxious to hear the prisoner defend himself. 146
Supple was very cool, challenged several of the panel & wisely refrained from
cross-examining any of the witnesses. In his address to the Jury he complained
of being tried again for what he said was the same offence for which he had
been sentenced. He described graphically the terrors of the condemed cell &
the punishment he had already undergone & considered it was not fair play if
even it were legal to put him [repeated] again on his trial. He justified the
Shooting at Smith as there was no other way of dealing with such a crafty
slanderer, said every true man woman or child in the Colony was equally
concerned with him & appealed to the jury to show their detestation of slander
& slanderers by returning a verdict of not guilty. Supple?s speech was well
delivered & very much to the point. The jury were locked up for six hours &
then discharged as they could not agree, it seems some wished to reduce the
crime to ?shooting with intent to do grievous bodily harm? instead of ?with
intent to murder?. A funny idea that a man who fires barrel after barrel at
another & afterwards acknowledges he wanted to kill him, should be
considered only inclined to wound & not to destroy. It shows however public
opinion to be against hanging Supple & so the government had better wait
patiently for the result of the Appeal & leave him alone till then.
Went to the Yorick Club in the afternoon & read for some time. Had a
little chat there with Neild. Parliament opened to-day, the new Local Force
made their first appearance in public & marched very well. Sent Edwin
Smith his newspapers which arrived by the Mail.
October 29 Saturday 1870
Weather wet nearly the whole of the day. Account in the papers of great
floods at Ballaarat & other places, at Coleraine nine persons are said to have
been drowned & much damage has been caused at other parts of the Colony.
Went to Melbourne after twelve o clock & looked in at the Yorick before I
went home to lunch. Took Polly in the evening to a Bazaar at the Town Hall
in aid of the Catholic Refuge, meant to spend a pound or there about as I
believe the Institution is very deserving. There was however really nothing
145 By Charles Dickens.
146 Having previously been tried for the killing of the bystander Walsh.


to buy worth having except some Fancy work made up into chairs & some
of the work was very beautiful but the price of the articles was far beyond our
slender purse. Chatted a little while with Mrs Testar who as usual had a stall,
should have liked to have spent our mite with her but really could?ent. Paid
a shilling for a letter that was brought me & that besides the admission
money was all I spent, felt shabby but must make it up to the Refuge in some
other way. There seemed very little life at the Bazaar & for fun & business it
was not to be compared with even the poorest of the Beechworth Bazaars; it
might certainly have got better after we went away & it is true we did not
stay very long. Went into the Arcade & saw very good large photographs of
Mr & Mrs Wintle, could not help thinking how much better the Fancy
Shops in the Arcade looked than the Stalls at the Bazaar. After a turn through
Paddy?s Market we bought The Australasian & then came home & soon went
to bed. Harry?s Desk was changed to day for a better & more expensive one.
The new purchase cost 12/6.
October 30 Sunday 1870
The weather was dry though the sky had a very unsettled appearance. Went to
church with Polly & four of the youngsters, came home. Polly very hungry &
quite ready to enjoy her dinner which with confidence she anticipated would
be very good. Nice fat quarter of lamb & all the adjuncts to make it particularly
palatable. Alas for the vanity of human calculations, the meat had gone bad &
when before the fire sent out a perfume not of Araby the blest? for that was not
to be expected, but one far from suitable to give a tone to the stomach. Polly
cried but made a tolerable meal after all on vegetables & pudding. Went to
Hawthorn by the five o clock train & got to Kerferd?s in time for tea, when I
did ample justice to some boiled mutton tinned by the Echuca meat preserving
company. Morrison was at Kerferd?s, remained chatting till it was time to leave
for the Train, got home before ten o clock. Met Mr Neubar in the Railway
Carriage; he has come to town to reside & has given up Beechworth for the
present. As usual there was something to prevent his Vineyard from yielding a
glorious Return from the last Vintage but as usual also it is sure to be all right
next one. Katey Morphy came across to see Polly & the youngsters. Dr
Robertson took Walter out with Mrs Robertson for a drive, the youngster
enjoyed himself & when asked how far he had been said ?Oh about 300 miles?.
Good long drive for Sunday afternoon.
October 31 Monday 1870
The weather was again fine & if it continues so trade will doubtless revive &
the Colony get into a better state. At present every one & everything seems
laboring under great depression. The floods have done immense mischief &
it will doubtless be some time before the mischief caused by them can be
repaired. This was baby?s birthday & he was presented with five shillings


which he at once presented to Jane who certainly by the care she has taken of
him deserved well some recognition of her services. 147 There was a report
current in the Sheriff?s office that the Executive intended dealing with the
appointment of Sheriff & that their decision would probably be arrived at
this evening. Walford was somewhat excited about it. I shall be very glad
when the appointment is really made.
Met Wheeler this afternoon, to-day was also his baby?s birthday so we
fraternised at the Yorick & I drank some claret with him. Telo 148 came in so
the three of us played cribbage together. I was remarkably unlucky & only
won one game, put my name down in a sweep at the Yorick for the
Melbourne Cup 10/- tickets. 149 First horse �l2, second �4 third �l. Came
home about eight, Polly went to see Mrs Edwards this afternoon. We are to
have bells hung in the house. Polly went to McEwan?s to choose the pulls &c.
November 2 Wednesday 1870
The weather dry & pleasant. Went into town this morning & called at the
Bank. The house in confusion, the Paper Hangers have not yet finished &
the bell-hangers have just commenced, shall not be clear of them for more
than a week. Polly troubled very much with neuralgia.
Paid nurse wages to this date & advanced �1.6.6 to pay butcher. Mr Sturt
visited the Gaol & sentenced Mary Kelly to two months imprisonment for
destroying her bedding. At Muster time this young lady amused herself with
threatening to destroy her bedding again & complimented the officers by
calling them cows. I ordered her bedding to be taken from her & as she
would not undertake not to tear it, it was kept from her. I punished myself
for I was very nervous all night under the dread the girl might attempt
suicide; she has been in the Asylum though Dr McCrea pronounces her to be
quite sane. As I am writing this on Thursday I am glad to say my dread was
only a night-mare & that Miss Mary Kelly was quite well in the morning.
This (Wednesday) morning my first report was to the effect that a man had
died in the Hospital. This was a man I had not seen as he was received while
I was at the Court, & as I was detained till seven o clock I did not muster last
evening. Went into Melbourne in the evening, took a book to the Mechanics
& read for a time at the Yorick.
November 3 Thursday 1870
A fine day to-day. Polly suffering I am sorry to say very much from neuralgia,
getting out of temper with having the workmen about the house. The bell-
147 The baby was their last, Ernest Buckley (1869-1909). Jane was a prisoner employed by
Polly as an occasional nurse.

hanging will be a bigger job than was at first anticipated. There was an
Inquest this morning & a jury-man on it who had the audacity to ask
questions & ?want to know, you know?. He was promptly bullied by Dr
McCrea & then soaped & wiped over by Dr Youl, after which of course he
subsided & allowed things to come comfortably to a conclusion.
Dr Youl told me the female prisoners were to be brought to this Gaol & that
it was not intended to keep any sentenced men here at all. I can hardly see how
this is to be carried out at any rate for some considerable time first & neither can
I see what advantage will be gained; the sentenced men must be kept somewhere
& as there is room in Melbourne Gaol for them why should they be taken away?
November 8 Tuesday 1870
Weather dry but changeable looking. Was at the Sheriff?s office this morning,
had a chat with some of the Court officals. The Argus after giving a description
of the ?flogging? yesterday wound up with saying it was a farce & blaming the
Gaol Authorities for employing an old & decrepit man like Bamford.
Wrote to Alderdice.
Not very well in the afternoon, quite tired of having the workmen in the
house. Polly has not been very well for some days.
Went to the Mechanics in the evening & changed a book, then went over to
the Yorick, did not stay very long, looked through all the Country papers, their
correspondents all described the flogging yesterday as having been very severe. I
took Major Ratcliffe this morning & showed him the back of the man who was
flogged. The Major was quite satisfied the man had been severely punished.
November 9 Wednesday 1870
Weather fine. Great number of people about Melbourne from all parts of the
Colony on account of the attraction of the Races. Went into town this
morning, met Emma with Joe & Wm. Lotherington, they agreed to come up
& lunch with us. Mustered in the afternoon & then went to the Yorick where
I did a little reading. This was the anniversary of the Prince of Wales Birthday
& was kept as a Public Holiday. Most of the shopkeepers however kept open
& announced they would close to-morrow for the Cup Day. Went to the
Club in the evening & drew ?Mischief? in a Sweep, made a bet also with
Levey, taking 9 to one on Croydon for the Cup.
Came home soon & after a read & a smoke went to bed. Polly very unwell,
she could not get to sleep for some time. Polly met Mrs Dempster while she
was shopping to-day. The Lotheringtons had lunch with us as they promised.
Emma is losing some of her pupils at Xmas. Polly is thinking whether we can
help her at all. Emma would like to teach Sissy & Dotty & so would I like
her to do if we could afford to pay for it. If it is to be done to suit both parties
however I see that it will be managed as Polly has her heart set upon doing
something of the kind.


November 10 Thursday 1870
A very fine day, just the one for a holiday & so all Melbourne seemed to think
for thousands cast away business & got the best way they could to the Race
Course to see the ?Cup? contest. I went to the Albion in the morning & saw
several Beechworth men, among others George Graham & Fisher. They
wanted me badly to go to the Course but I declined & went back to the Gaol
where I stayed till after muster. Nimblefoot won the Cup, considered almost
an outsider until Saturday last when he rose in estimation from winning the
Hotham Stakes, he did not however go up very much in the betting & started
at 12 to 1. Lapdog ran a good race & came in only a head behind the winner.
Valentine an Ovens horse & almost an outsider, got third place. I lost �2.18
with Sweeps & a bet I made. Gibson came from Geelong; he was most
anxious to take Dotty back with him to cheer up Mrs Gibson who it seems
is sick & very dull. Polly let Dotty go & Gibson took her away by the seven
o clock train. Was at the Yorick club after Muster & played some cribbage
with Wheeler; lost every game.
In the evening met George Graham & some Beechworth men & walked
about with them, went into an hotel & sat down for a time. I drank some claret
& kept very sober in consequence. Came home a little after eleven o clock.
Polly very unreasonable & I went to bed in a bad temper after taking two
glasses of grog instead of one as I should have done had I not been annoyed.
November 14 Monday 1870
A fine day. Got up at half past five & went into the Gaol, where I gave
directions with regard to Seery who was Executed this morning at ten o
clock. Seery was a strange kind of man & I was in some fear of a scene at the
last & felt in consequence very glad when all was over. The Inquest was held
in the Gaol at twelve o clock. After the Inquest I walked a part of the way
with Dr Youl who told me the Penal Commission intended to recommend
the removal of all the female prisoners to Pentridge & in fact to empty the
Gaol of sentenced prisoners male & female. I imagine there has been some
influence at work in behalf of the officers at Pentridge & that the Penal
Commission have been induced to change their views in consequence. It is
however idle to calculate upon what changes will really be made nor can I
judge whether the intended ones would work until I have had the
opportunity of conning the Report.
Drank more grog than I should have done for I got nervous about Seery &
then was excited with the talk I had with Dr Youl. Cuthbert came up & had
tea with us, after tea I went with him to the Railway Station. There was a
great crowd as it was the last day of the Excurtionists who were all returning
to Ballaarat Sandhurst &c. Edwards was at the station. I went to town in his
cab & afterwards went to the Theatre. Got home very late.


November 15 Tuesday 1870
A fine day, was very unwell this morning, took an emetic early in the
morning which upset me very much. Went into the Court about eleven o
clock. The Criminal Sittings commenced, the Chief Justice presiding. Was at
the Court till nearly seven o clock a capital case being on which lasted till that
hour. The Case was a very peculiar one. A man of the name of Forbes was
charged with committing a Rape on a woman in a boat between Sandridge
& St Kilda. The woman was proven to be a very loose character & gave as a
reason she did not cry out, that prisoner had his tongue in her mouth & so
she was prevented. It never struck the innocent that under the circumstances
she had the man in her power & that a vigorous bite would have effectively
dampened his ardour. A witness for the defence swore she had been in the
same room with the prosecutorix when the prisoner was with the
prosecutorix in bed. A Sergeant of Police swore the prosecutorix kept a
brothel & was a bad character, notwithstanding this the Chief Justice
summed up against the prisoner. The jury convicted & death was recorded
against him. Went to the Parliament House this evening, heard a portion of
the Financial Speech, went with Witt into the Strangers room where I
renewed acquaintance with Mr & Mrs Gregory with whom I had been
acquainted before I went to Beechworth.
November 25 Friday 1870
Made arrangements with Dr McCrea for the flogging of four larrikins on
Monday next. The young vagabonds of Melbourne require suppressing, one
named Dunavan repeatedly convicted, receive a day or two since a sentence
of twelve months Imprt. & at once informed the Magistrate ?he could do it
on his head?. To night at muster time I found him in one of the ordinary cells.
The young vagabond stepped forward & with a hypocritical whine asked to
be put along with the boys as (with a cunning leer) he did ent like to be with
the men. There is no doubt he was dreadfully afraid of contamination & I
took effectual means for seeing he did?ent suffer from bad example for
instead of putting him with ?the boys? as he termed it I gave him a cell to
himself. Instead of being thankful however he seemed disgusted.
November 27 Sunday 1870
Weather cloudy but without much rain. Was in bad temper & feeling unwell.
Polly took youngsters to church. The Bishop preached in aid of the Sunday
Schools attached to St John?s Church, according to Polly it was a most
effective sermon addressed most wisely to parents instead of their youngsters.
In the afternoon Polly took Sissy, Dotty & the baby to see Mrs Smith; while
they were away some heavy rain fell, they however found shelter & so escaped
getting wet. Emma & Agnes came to tea & before they went away I gathered


a bag of vegetables for Emma & a nosegay for Agnes. Harry & I went
through Fitzroy Gardens with Emma & Agnes, we got back sometime before
ten. Then I had to go into town & inform the Newspapers of the proposed
whipping of four larrikins to-morrow; called at the Yorick & wrote notes for
Argus & Telegraph. Came back & felt sorry Polly & I were not so good friends
as we ought to be so tried & made things pleasant, then went to bed far
happier than either of us would have been had we remained at variance. A
constable in plain clothes arrested a man outside the Gaol this morning
trying to communicate with the prisoners in the Labor Yard, he saw him
throw something over the wall which was seen come into the Yard &
obtained by one of Turnkeys.
November 28 Monday 1870
A tolerably fine day. Sissy?s Birthday, started her with half a crown to spend
for her Party. 150 Attended at the Police Court this morning. A young fellow
received a sentence of two months for throwing tobacco over the gaol wall.
Went to Smythers & ordered some spirits, went with him to a bonding store
to taste some Carlisle ale, met there Mr Tyson who knew Polly & her family.
The ale was very good indeed but I was afraid to purchase any as the smallest
sized cask held eighteen gallons & that perhaps would not when spiked keep
sound till it was all gone. Met Mr Ramsay who has given up business in
Beechworth & commenced at Melbourne. Four larrikins were flogged in the
Gaol this afternoon. Mr Ellis the Acting Sheriff brought in a number of quasi
gentlemen to see the Exhibition & they with the Reporters made almost a
crowd. The young fellows came to the ?Triangle? with their minds evidently
made up not to ?squeal?; they endured their punishment with simply a groan
or two though Jack 151 laid on heavily & they doubtless suffered considerably.
The crowd?s anxiety seemed to be that they should get it hot & not a sign of
compassion or disgust was shown by any of the lookers on. We read with
horror of the brutual exhibitions of the Romans with their Gladiators pitted
against one another or opposed to wild beasts & wonder how the populace
could delight in such cruel amusement. I do not however think the men of
the modern age are much different & I feel confident if a scene of the kind
was to take place in Melbourne to-morrow there would be any number of
applications for admission & some very severe criticisms on the deportment
of the Gladiators when dying or of the want of pluck shewn by the hyenas in
not taking their gruel quietly.

Lucia, Qld, 1972), pp. 173, 434-435.


December 4 Sunday 1870
A beautiful day though warm in the afternoon. Took three of the youngsters
to Church Polly not being at all strong or able to get much about. Had an
awfully tough cock for dinner & it was as much as ever I could do to saw off
his legs & wings; so much for your ?grand cock? said little Dotty, so much for
your ?grand-pa? said I.
Mr Semple & Mr Kane came up this afternoon to see Supple. They came
to the private entrance so I asked them in to the dining room & took the
opportunity of speaking to Kane about Edwin Smith. He took away Edwin?s
letter & promised to send me an answer the next day. After Muster I wrote a
page in my diary & then started off to catch the five o clock train for
Hawthorn, reached the Railway in every good time & got all right to
Kerferd?s house. Elliot & Mrs Elliot were there. I left in time to get home by
the quarter past eight o clock train. Went to the Yorick. There was a little
Party assembled, McKinlay, Purvis, Kane & Tracey. The Doctor was
discoursing on the evils of stimulants & in his remarks attributed most of the
illnesses of ladies to the habit of taking a glass of wine or something of the
kind on feeling faint. He said a calculation had been made & a lady during
?The Season? takes daily, just to keep herself up & without the slightest idea
of being anything else than moderate, as much alcohol in her system as
Hodge the labourer who takes during a debauch his four or five glasses of ale
& reels away muddled to bed.
Tracey urged the non-necessity of stimulants & said that they cannot be
used in this colony without causing suffering sooner or later. He was asked
how the ?old ones? used to manage who were notorious for drinking heavily
& living to good old ages. He said as a rule they had plenty of fresh air & did
not drink till after dinner. I reminded him of the strong ale formerly used at
breakfast. This he could?ent deny was used by our ancestors but he
maintained their system of drinking, though it often led them into excess,
was a better one for the constitution than the odious one of ?nipping? which
is the modern fashion.
December 7 Wednesday 1870
A fine day, a little rain fell before daylight but not enough to do more than
lay the dust. The air was however nice & cool even in the afternoon. Polly
still very weak. Engaged in the Gaol at one thing or another, made up my
accounts & could not make them balance satisfactorily. It is rather
disheartening to find the money goes away so persistently; it leaves my pocket
in a continual dropping & I am quite unable to stop the stream or even check
it for very long together. This is bad enough but it is very disgusting after
keeping careful accounts to prove yourself by actual counting worse off than
even the figures show.


Went to the Mechanics in the evening & changed a book for Polly, looked in
at The Yorick & had a yarn with Levey & Pickersgill, came home, got some
medicine for Polly on the way, had a smoke & went to bed a little after
ten o clock.
The Penal Commission?s Progress Report was published in this morning?s
Argus , it contained nothing but what I expected, except it proposes the
appointment of a Governor of the Penitentiary at Pentridge instead of that
prison being under the control of an Inspector General as at present. The
Inspector General states the Commission should inspect all prisons
constantly but be independent of any of them. The women are to come to
Melbourne till a prison can be got ready for them at Pentridge.
This morning an old man was being discharged from Gaol who had over
�9O cash; he was in a great way for fear he should be robbed by some of the
prisoners who had been discharged & who knew he had the money. I sent a
Turnkey down with him with directions to deposit most of the money in one
of the banks & then to give the man the receipt. The pair were followed by
some one evidently looking after the old man.
December 9 Friday 1870
A fine day. Polly not very well still feeling weak. Ellis sent for me this
morning & told me he had a letter from the Chief Secretary requesting him
to make arrangements with Mr Duncan for the removal from Pentridge of
the female prisoners to Melbourne Gaol. I consulted with Mrs Gee & found
I could manage well enough in the present Wing & so I told Ellis. The only
anxiety I have is about the female staff for fear some of my own officers will
have to go to make room for some of the Pentridge ones, however Mrs Gee
is the one I care most about & Ellis declared she should be safe.
Sullivan who gave so much trouble some little time since & who has since
been doing a little Bushranging, was captured to-day & brought to the Gaol.
He states all the stories about him are false & made up by the detectives but
this of course is about the only defence he can have as the evidence is direct
& straightforward against him.
After Tea I went into Melbourne & called in at the Yorick, then I took a walk
up Bourke Street & went into Parliament House, sent up my card to Kerferd &
gained admittance. The Insolvency Bill was before the House & was not very
interesting to me. Whiteman beckoned as he passed out & I went into the
refreshment room with him. Gill was there talking to McLellan. Gill said he
would call & see me before Christmas & said he had my scrip. I told him I should
be glad to see him but if I can get my ten pound it will be more than I expect.
December 10 Saturday 1870
A beautiful day, got up at half past five o clock & induced Polly to get up
shortly afterwards, went into the Gaol then took Polly & the two little girls


to the Eastern Market. Met Mrs Robertson & family who were on the way
to the Market also; the weather was jolly & every one very cheerful. The
market was crowded both with sellers & buyers. Polly bought a lot of chicks
& I speculated on a couple of pigs, then I got some cherries, cakes and figs
for the youngsters, then frightened at my extravagance I had to shut up my
pocket & make with Polly & youngsters for home & breakfast; much
excitement amongst the youngsters when the pigs arrived, Dotty disgusted
at their persisting in putting their feet into the trough while they were
getting their breakfast. The Police were desirous of having the photographs
of Sullivan & Leigh, the young fellows who after being discharged from
Gaol went in for a little Bushranging. I agreed that Mr Nettleton should
come & take the pictures. Leigh cut up rough & would?ent have his likeness
taken on any account & did not till two turnkeys by my orders siezed him
& forced him to sit down on a stool opposite the camera. He threatened a
bit but eventually the turnkeys let him loose & he sat still though he looked
awfully sulky. Sullivan was delighted at having his picture taken, wanted it
badly to be done with his cap on but agreed to take his cap off if the
Photographer would promise to take one afterwards with the cap on. This
was agreed to.
Went into Melbourne after twelve o clock walked down with Ellis. Met
while I was out Howard who used to be connected with the Beechworth
Coaches & who lived at Wangaratta. He had been home to the Old Country
& returned to the Colony about a fortnight since. Met Neuber & went with
him to his wine seller, bought a dozen of colonial wine from him.
Went to the Yorick Club in the afternoon. In the evening took Polly &
Harry into Bourke Street, purchased some lollies at the Eastern Market &
then after buying The Australasian came home & went to bed. Felt very
bilious so took some pills.
December 18 Sunday 1870
A dull day close & disagreeable as well. Hardly thought it safe to take the
youngsters to church or to risk Polly?s new bonnet, however we went & got
back with out wet enough to do any harm. Mrs Warded the Nursery
Governess almost downhearted about the children; they have been allowed to
get so wild, that it is almost more than the Governess can do to make them
behave decently at the table or to one another. They are all so strong & lusty
that the management of them is a serious business. Mrs Warded says they
have ad good dispositions & that there is no vice in any of them but they
fight hard with her for the mastery. Polly gave Mrs Warded full authority to
act as she thought right & to punish the youngsters if they did?ent turn over
a new leaf & be more obedient.
At dinner time the youngsters were so quiet that Mr Stoddart was quite
alarmed as he did?ent hear them when he was passing through the Front Yard


& asked Polly if they were ill. Felt lazy this afternoon & as Polly also we went
upstairs & laid down for nearly an hour. I did not Muster either but made an
excuse of being unwell the cause of my not doing so. Mrs Morphy & Mr De
Verdon came over to our house in the afternoon. After tea I went into town
& called at the Yorick. Had a pleasant hour?s chat with Wheeler, Brown,
Purvis, Stark, Ogier & one or two others, got home at half past nine. Polly
took the baby to ensure Mrs Wardell a good night?s rest, the young vagabond
was kicking & crowing till midnight & it must be very hard for Mrs Wardell
after her long day with the children to be kept awake by even a laughing baby.
December 24 Saturday 1870
Another dull day, the weather is not at all like the traditional Christmas
weather of Australia. Part of the officers were allowed leave. I stopped about
the Gaol & mustered as usual. Between five & six o clock I was at the Yorick
where I played some games of cribbage with Purvis & McKinlay. Came home
to tea & had a stir at the Xmas pudding which was in preparation, dropped
a sixpence into the mixture which is exciting much interest among the
youngsters as to its eventual ownership. After the younger brats were put to
bed, Polly & myself went into town with Harry, Sissy, Dotty & Eddy & were
squeezed through Bourke Street, The Arcade & Paddy?s Market. For most of
the time I did Pater-familias with a basket rather heavy with cake which we
purchased at Hosie?s pie shop in Bourke Street. The proprietor informed me
that a cake he had made weighing 404 lbs was sold in 4 1/2 hours; it was
advertised to contain a number of gold rings, hence the run after it. There
were some bright Scotch lasses engaged in the shop, one of them said she
believed they could have sold half a dozen cakes of the size. Harry had a four-
penny piece which he soon expended in a noted weakness of his, buns. Dotty
was captivated with some apricots & her Joey went for eight of them. Eddy
bought a basket & Sissy being of still more frugal mind kept hers for another
day. Sissy however had five shillings of her own which she said she should
spend in something useful & the little old woman in consequence carefully
expended three shillings in a market basket which would be handy for her
when her mamma sent her out to buy trifles for the house. Took the
youngsters home then went out again with Polly & purchased the Fairy?s
Gifts which on our return Mamma duly placed in the various stockings hung
up in expectation of the visit of Father Klaus. Got to bed by twelve o clock,
Polly was however restless & it was some time before we got to sleep.
December 25 Sunday 1870
A rather cloudy day but most comfortable weather & not at all like the
traditional Christmas as there was very little heat & very few flies. Woke this
morning unrefreshed & with a bilious head ache. The baby kept us awake a
good deal during the night & woke us very early indeed this morning. After


breakfast went into the garden & picked some ?green stuff? to hang about the
house & give it some little appearance of holiday time. Polly took some of
the youngsters to church & I passed the morning reading The Australasian.
Soon after the Missus & the youngsters got back from church, Aunt Emma,
Uncle Joe, Godfrey & [blank space] made their appearance & dinner was
soon on the table; the goose was a great success &C the pudding turned out
remarkedly well. Dinner was served nicely altogether & we all made a hearty
meal as well as a sociable & jolly one. The sixpence I stirred into the pudding
ingloriously was cut into by Mrs Warded on the first stroke of her knife, so
all the mystery & expectation was put an end to, perhaps it was just as well
as some of the boys had vowed they would keep on eating pudding until the
sixpence was got by some one or other. Sent some mulberries over to Mrs
Robertson & had a few as well for our own table. Joe had his pipe & I stole
away & got a sleep for an hour on the sofa in the Drawing Room.
Had a quiet cosy tea & a chat till Joe & Emma thought it was time to go
home, they left Godfrey to be company for Harry. Polly & I took a stroll
round the garden & then as soon as Mrs Warded came home we went to bed.
This day was a strange one. It being Sunday Christmas Day could not be
made the boisterous one it generally is while the quiet of the Sabbath was a
good deal disturbed by the plum pudding, toys & other seasonable adjuncts.
I am at any rate glad to say that there was peace & good will in our house &
that assures me there was not very much wickedness in the manner the day
was passed.
December 28 Wednesday 1870
A hot day, still one that it was very lucky to get at this time of the year. Rose
tolerably early & was employed in the Gaol Offices for nearly ad the day.
Cannot push on, find everything against any alteration & a dread of
incurring any responsibility, a terror of getting a snub or a surly answer stops
many a great reformer in the Civil Service even in little or trifling matters.
Those who receive good ?screws?, honorable men though they may be still see
nothing to win & some from experience have been bitterly taught that zeal
in the Government Service is out of place & that the model Civil Servant is
one who does the least he can, takes ad the leave he can get & has a claim or
a grievance ready whenever there is an opening for a spec in the Department
or elsewhere so long as it be in the Service, for mark you this officer is verily
& truly a ?Barnacle? & though he can fid sheets of Demi with astonishing
proofs of his own ability, energy & self denial & his important services to the
State, yet left him with a kick out of his position & who so helpless, who so
poor as wants his service. P?sha this is bile perhaps. The thought arose of Ellis,
with his �IOOO a year & his little ways has stirred up the enemy. 152 Upon my
152 Ellis had been appointed Sheriff; Castieau's salary at this time was �375 p.a.


soul liver you are unkind to him for if all things to all men deserve success,
then Ellis should be even far more astonished at his position than he is at
present for he should have a much higher one.
What shall I do with the little space left me to-day? Bother business, I was
going to add bother detail but this is a Diary & so it is necessary for me to
observe that Hall & Wife, Cuthbert & Wife & some stray kids of both
families had tea with us. 153 Like my luck, Cuthbert walked off with my new
hat & left me in its place a very greasy & disreputable looking one. Took
tickets for the Pantomime & went to the Upper Boxes this evening. Took
Harry, Sissy & Dotty, Harry Lotherington & Edith Cuthbert. Got very good
places though we had to go very early to secure them. There was a very good
house but not a crowded one for the third night of the Pantomime. This was
the first production of Marcus Clarke in the Dramatic Line & was looked
forward to with a great deal of interest. The idea was good, the opening
readable but the effect when represented, slow. It was rather too long & there
was nothing striking thoughout; some puerile local verses sung by Harwood
was the only feature that created anything like general applause.
The Duvallis danced wonderfully, the elder sister represented the girl ?with
nothing on? & well she did it showing very carefully & determinedly the
character she was representing. It is a nuisance my paper is run out. I had?ent
nearly done, got home, big glass of toddy & Bed. Baby. No sleep. Fun. Row.
Sofa. Stiff next morning.
December 31 Saturday 1870
The last day of 1870; growled considerably and put on a very gloomy &
sulky appearance. There was a great deal of wind but only about as much rain
as was required to make people afraid to venture out for the holiday. There
were Races but I imagine they were poorly attended & I heard there were not
more than a dozen ladies on the Course. I went into Melbourne in the
morning & had a look at the people moving about. The Banks were closed
but with that exception the City wore a very every day appearance. Mustered
in the afternoon, afterwards went to the Yorick & played a few games of
Cribbage with McKinlay. After tea induced Edwin Smith to go to the Opera,
then took Polly out for a stroll, there was a fine healthy breeze blowing & the
walk did us both good, we got home by ten o clock & I should have liked to
have gone to bed but Polly was determined to see ?The Old Year Out? & ?The
New Year In? so we sat up. Polly went over to Mrs Morphy?s & at about half
past eleven I called at Dr Robertson?s where I thought Polly had gone, sat &
chatted till De Verdon came & asked us to go into Mrs Morphy?s but the
doctor made him stop & have a glass of toddy. Katey Morphy came & she
had to stop & have a glass of wine, & still the doctor did not budge; however
153 The Halls and Cuthberts, i.e. the families of Polly's sisters, Dotty (Dora) and Nellie
(Eleanor).


*'' ~' ' 1^

we all went in to wish a Happy New Year though it had got rather late. Mrs
Hare & Mrs Snodgrass & daughter were at Morphy's as was also Mr
Cameron Lucy's last beau. We laughed, then we tried 'Auld Lang Syne' but
failed, then a Country Dance with no more success & then succeeded in the
first set. There was the usual amount of good wishes a little romping & then
every one felt it was time to go & so the Party broke up. There was a light in
Dr Robertson's room so Polly & I went in & wished him a good night then
after a glass of wine came away home. Edwin Smith was sitting up. More
compliments of the Season & then to bed & so farewell for ever 1870.

Chapter 4: 1871
'Trying to swim to America
A diary to be useful must be truthful,? Castieau reminded himself while
writing up his entry for 20 August 1871. In 1871 there was much
demanding a frank facing up to facts, money worries above all. Such was the
plight of the Castieaus that late in this year Polly would take on herself the
task of resolving their debts, visiting creditors, and pressing Castieaus case for
support through the family friendship with the Kerferds. Being ?truthful?,
Castieau did not shrink from recording his continuing reckless expenditure
on betting, drinking and occasionally more purposeful consumption. An
example of the last was the �9.0.0 (more than a week?s salary) spent at an
auction of books of a former Victorian premier.
The world around J.B. and Polly pressed down in its own way. This was the
year of the suppression of the Paris Commune, a bloody event whose echoes
were registered regularly in Melbourne. Closer to life?s fortunes were the plays
of colonial politics. Castieaus anxiety about his working future so soon after
returning to Melbourne was heightened by the drawn-out process of a royal
commission inquiring into the colony?s prisons. The close associations of the
Melbourne political world encouraged rumour and alarm and when Castieau
heard directly from the commission secretary, the journalist David Blair, that
the gaol was to be demolished and replaced by a comprehensive ?house of
correction? his worst fears were confirmed. In the end the gaol survived this
and other attempts to bring it to an early demise, but its governor would be
left constantly defensive of its role and agitated by the indifference of the
world about him to the worth and frustrations of his work. No wonder then
that by the middle of the year Castieau was sleeping uneasily, his rest
disturbed by repeated dreaming that ?I was trying to swim to America?, a vain
effort that left him ?weary and exhausted?.
The ambivalence of the earnest public servant was highlighted in 1871 by an
incident that might have brought more recognition, had that been truly sought.
Penal matters were issues of the day?this was after all the period during which
Marcus Clarke was producing the serial version of For the Term of His Natural
Life, the novel that became the most enduring reference point for Australian
memories of the convict era. Friendship with Marcus Clarke, initially through the
Yorick Club, brought some promise of notice for Castieaus ideas about prisons
and punishment, such as he had developed them. Yet Clarke?s invitation to
Castieau to supply copy on the subject for the literary magazine The Australian
Journal turned somewhat sour through what Castieau characteristically saw as a
careless lack of attention to the protocols seemingly necessary when public
servants commented on public policy.


Not all was gloom. The edited journal can convey only part of the sense of
a regular domestic routine in which Castieau was daily engaged in attending
to the education of his many children?reading to and with them, doing
their sums, playing cards, and increasingly as they grew older walking them
to the city, shopping, church-going and taking Sunday excursions to visit
other family members or friends at St Kilda or Kew. And of course there is
life with Polly, whose opinion must be sought on letters of promotion or
letters to the papers, with whom there are ?barnies?, but quite as often times
when she is ?very good tempered?. The almost unimaginable possibility of life
without her was brought home to Castieau late in 1871 by Polly?s decision to
take a break of some weeks to visit her family and friends in Beechworth and
the north-east. The experience highlighted the choices before Castieau, if
melodramatically: ?This week were it not for the cowardice of leaving the
children to the mercy of the world I should have ?leaped the bridge?. Thank
God there was still manliness left in me to make me ashamed of the thought
& save me from the Devil whispering oblivion in my ear.? 154
January 2 Monday 1871
Woke this morning with great inclination to go somewhere away from home
which inclination was well fostered by my affectionate spouse. I began taking
The Argus this morning & we looked to see what there was to be seen & where
there was to go. The Aldinga a fine boat which usually trades between
Melbourne & Adelaide was advertised for QueensclifF, fare 7/6, all profits to be
devoted to the Orphans of Emerald Hill. Four hours & a half on shore was the
great inducement held out & eagerly the public took the bait. The crowd on
board was very great, between six hundred & seven hundred paying passengers.
There is?ent room here to describe the crushing, the sickness or the feeding &
drinking, suffice it [to say] on the whole the voyage was a very pleasant one &
we arrived in the neighbourhood or off QueensclifF in capital spirits & tolerable
condition. Now came the rub, the Aldinga could?ent get to the Pier & the small
boats would?ent take us on shore. As may be imagined there was a row on board
& any amount of obloquy heaped on the Committee of Management
prominent among whom was Mr Whiteman the Member for Emerald Hill.
However it was no use making a fuss & so after a time things quieted down &
the Captain ordered the anchor up & brought us away home where we arrived
shortly after seven o?clock. Came up by the train & arrived at home before eight
o clock ... wrote an account of my trip & sent it to The Argus, nay I took it and
saw the Sub Editor who said he would give it to the Editor when he came in.
January 9 Monday 1871
A very fine day. Got up in time to see the officers on Parade, went about the
Gaol until it was nearly breakfast time. Edwin Smith not at all in a hurry &
154 Diary, 2 October 1871.


had not made his appearance at half past nine o?clock. He seems studying
with a vengeance. Went into Melbourne & called at the office of the
Inspector Genl. of Penal Establishments, saw Mr Duncan & chatted with
him about materials for the women. Called upon Drury. There was a great
crowd gathered about the Police Court the Watch House being filled with
men & women who had been taken out of houses in Romeo Lane & charged
by the Police with being rogues & vagabonds. About 80 were arrested out of
which 22 men & 22 women were sent to Gaol. As may be imagined the Gaol
was very busy also in the afternoon. The Chief Justice brought Mrs Lloyd
Jones of Avenel & a party of youngsters to see the Gaol. Mrs Jones & the
children thought hominy was delicious food & the children actually
scrambled for their share in a small dish that was sent up from the Kitchen.
One of the girls asked her sister if she should?ent like to have it always!
?Well?not always,? was the very sensible reply. Mr William & his Party then
came into the Quarters & duly admired Law?s pen & ink sketches. Mustered
528 prisoners, about 200 over the average number. When I went into the
house to tea found Joe, Emma, Harry & brother Bill all assembled. Mrs
Gibson had sent a letter inviting Harry to go down to Geelong to stay for the
Holidays so Polly left the table & took him down to meet Cuthbert at the
Train. While she was away my guests amused themselves gathering
mulberries some of which are very fine this year. Edwin Smith went out &
on his return at a little after eleven told us he had been to the Opera & that
it had pleased him very much. Heard a man passing the house singing out
oysters?, hailed him & ordered a couple of dozen which were duly polished
off in a workman like manner by Polly & myself, share & share alike. Bought
a new pipe to-night which I smoked oftener than was good for me.
January 22 Sunday 1871
Another hot day. Our bed-room grows more & more like a heated oven. Took
Sissy, Dotty, Harry & Nelly Hall to church. Our usual clergyman did not
preside. I think however he was a Barlow, probably the brother of our ?Barlow?.
We generally on Sundays dine in the middle of the day, to-day however we
breakfasted late, had to kill a goose & dinner was not ordered till four o?clock.
I was sitting between one & two o?clock quietly enjoying a chapter in Vanity
Fair J55 when there was a bustling noise close to the Gaol. Polly looked out of
the window & immediately called out ?run Castieau there is some prisoners
escaping!? I lost no time in getting into the street & soon saw a Constable &
Quin bringing back Sullivan, a notorious prisoner waiting trial for
Bushranging. I asked if there was anyone else away & Quin said ?Yes?. I ran on
& at the end of a Right of Way saw Baker a prisoner waiting trial for Burglary
taken out of a closet where he had taken refuge. On getting back to the Gaol
I found that the above prisoners with another named Leigh alias Smith,
155 William Makepeace Thackeray, Vanity Fair , originally published serially in 1847?1848.

News , 5 February 1887
a mate of Sullivan, had rushed from the Radiating Yards where they were
taking Exercise into the Porch leading to the New Wing, closing the door
behind them. Sullivan & Baker managed to get to the top & to burst through
a skilight on to the Wall of the Gaol. Leigh was captured not having been able
to get up. Sullivan & Baker ran along the Wall which communicates with the
outer Wall of the Gaol & on getting to the outer Wall dropped on my fowl-
house, reached the ground and were captured as I have described.
January 24 Tuesday 1871
The weather changed & it was a great deal cooler to-day. Busy this morning
in the office with the Sheriff. Ranking was charged with talking to a prisoner
at his cell window. He admitted the offence & acknowledged having done
wrong. Mr Ellis however on account of his previous character did not punish
him. When the case was over I told Ranking in the presence of the Sheriff
how surprised I had been to learn that Mrs Ranking had been to my house
& had threatened to see the Chief Secretary with regard to my servants & the
things I had made for me. I said if you or your wife have any complaints to
make or charges to bring against me do so at once. Ellis said he wished he
had known of this before the Case was decided. Ranking denied knowing of
what his wife had done & said he would?ent have encouraged her in anything
of the kind. I let the matter drop observing that threats would not prevent
me doing what I considered to be my duty. In the afternoon Mr Blair & Mr
Strutt, two of the Penal Commissioners, visited the Gaol to see where
Sullivan went up the Wall. I showed them the place & they were astonished.
I then brought Sullivan and asked him to show us how he got up. He did so
willingly. The Porch is six feet wide, Straight Walls of plain ashlar twenty feet
high. Sullivan put his feet against one wall & his hands against the other &
though he was encumbered with leg irons went up the Wall almost as easy as


though he were walking on the ground. I was astonished as well as Messrs
Blair & Strutt. In the afternoon before this time I went to the Bank &
afterwards looked in at the Yorick Club. In the evening I went to see the
Gregorys. The performing dogs are exceedingly well trained & act very
willingly as well as cleverly.
I went of course to see the ?Female Gymnast?. Her performance is very
daring & she seems at perfect ease while performing on the trapeze or
trusting herself to the nerve & strength of Brother John.
January 28 Saturday 1871
A rather pleasant day, the weather being cool & refreshing after the great heat.
Mr McCall my Chief Clerk came to the Gaol this morning but was not able to
remain as his nose commenced bleeding & he found it impossible to stop it.
This being Saturday the other clerk was away as a matter of course &
consequently I was left without any one in the office. I stayed in the Gaol the
whole of the day & found there was a great deal of work in the office & that it
was all the worse for me to do, as it was differently done from the way in which
I did mine at Beechworth. Went to the Yorick after four o?clock but did not
stop long. Came home & finished Vanity Fair before tea-time. What a
wonderful book is that Vanity Fair & yet rather muddled at the end. The
Author apparently tiring of his work & in haste to pack up his puppets & to
be off to some other Fair before the Stands were all taken & the Only Sight
would have the chance of a show. Becky, that little glimpse of your love of
brandy and water towards the end of your career militates against the
hypocritical respectable end of your story; had the bottle of Cognac been your
comfort in your perplexities it would have been your ruin & there would have
been no charitable old lady attending Fancy Fairs but a Harridan wandering
from bad to worse till the Gaol, after repeated vomits, could through you out
no longer & held an Inquest as in duty bound on you instead. Went into
Melbourne with Polly in the evening, came home & got to bed.
January 29 Sunday 1871
Cloudy, inclined to rain in the morning but did not. Went to Church in the
Gaol. There was an anthem & the singing was quite satisfactory to the Rev.
Mr Studdert who was of course the principal person to whom satisfaction
was required to be given.
Was up very early in the morning & saw a rope that was found by Turnkey
Long hidden away in the Radiating Yard. Grumbled & growled a good deal,
then looked about a little & eventually gave instructions which I hope may
be attended to. Mustered this afternoon, then sat & read till tea time. After
tea had more than an hour with the youngsters reading to them from
Grimms Goblins. After that I went into Melbourne & visited the Yorick. Had
a chat & then came away home where I got at a very little after nine o?clock.


We were talking at the Yorick about the Larrikins & the cause of their
infliction on the community. 156 Dr Gilbee who was present attributed the
nuisance to the fact that the children of the Colony were turned into the
street to get rid of them, the climate being so good that they could be there
without injury to their health if that was cared about more than their being
out of the way, where in the street they picked up street acquaintances and
street ways & not being content with being in the street by day, they
remained at night & so, though perhaps belonging to careless more than
vicious parents, degenerated into veritable street Arabs.
February 8 Wednesday 1871
The weather was fine to-day. I was at the General Sessions Court some time
& did not get away from it until between seven & eight o?clock. An old man
was being tried for an indecent assault upon a child. The wretch was no
doubt guilty but he was defended by Mr Ireland who managed to make
something of a defence & created a great deal of laughter in the Court by the
manner in which he endeavoured to ridicule away the evidence of the
analytical chemist Mr Johnson. Analytical chemistry certainly is sometimes
very dangerous for Juries to rely upon the differences between entirely
distinct objects being frequently so infinitesimal that it is most difficult to be
quite satisfied the chemist may not have made a mistake in naming
something that would hang a man for what if properly called he would not
be obliged to account for at all.
Dotty came in to dinner. While she was with us Brett called. He would not
stop long. After Brett was gone of course the conversation turned to Marriage
with a deceased wife?s sister. Dotty & I chaffed about it but Polly was
disgusted & I have been in her bad books ever since. Went in the evening to
the Yorick Club where I met Levey & Harrison. Had a chat & then home.
February 13 Monday 1871
A pleasant day, very warm though in the evening. Folks are on the qui vive
for the mail which will be due to-morrow & which is hourly expected as the
Steamers have kept such good time for so many months. Busy in the office
in the morning & was making up my Diary when Polly came into the office
& interrupted me while so occupied. She looked at what I had been writing
& noticed when I had entered, the fact that I found my Cash did not tally
with the accounts I had kept. This she did not like & talked very
unreasonably, in consequence we had a very unpleasant matrimonial tiff &
were as disagreeable one to the other as we could manage.
156 Larrikins were a preoccupation of public comment at this time. Marcus Clarke had
published an article on the Melbourne larrikins in The Australasian, 19 March 1870, a
type he characterised as irredeemably violent and egocentric: 'he doesn't care a fig for you
or anybody else'; see also Marcus Clarke, A Colonial City: High and Low Life: Selected
Journalism of Marcus Clarke (St. Lucia, Qld, 1972), pp. 78-79.


There was a man flogged this afternoon. The Members of the Press & the
usual loafers were present in addition to the officials. The prisoner was an old
hand with a face that would bring in a verdict of Guilty from most Juries. He
displayed most stolid endurance without the slightest bravado or flashness &
took his fifty lashes without a groan & scarcely a movement except a horrible
twitching & trembling in the muscles of his arms which he kept strained to
the utmost. This was the most severe flogging I have yet seen administered.
Marcus Clarke, ?The Peripatetic Philosopher? met me in the street this
morning & came to the Gaol to see the Punishment this afternoon. 157 I was
glad to see he did not believe much in its efficacy as a rule though he believed
flogging could occasionally be resorted to with advantage. Went into
Melbourne in the evening & called at the Yorick. Something very mysterious
going on among the youngsters, relative to Valentines I believe.
February 14 Tuesday 1871
Pleasant weather. I have allowed three days to pass without touching my
Diary & have had some excuse as I have been particularly busy & have had
many things to think about.
This was Valentine?s Day 158 & the youngsters were all a-gog anxiously looking
out for the Postman who was unusually late owing to the extra burthen he had
to carry in consequence of the numerous offerings to the Saint.
I received a very pretty Valentine & all the youngsters got one each. It was of
course a great study for me to think out correctly the Party who sent my Valentine
& I am sure I never could have guessed unless Dotty at dinner time who was
evidently swelling with a big secret disclosed the mystery. Sissy said dont you see
it is from your sweetheart? so I looked & saw it was so written; the[n] Dotty
could contain herself no longer & said ?I sent if & Sissy said ?of course, could?ent
you see it was from your Sweetheart?? I confessed my stupidity & went on with
my dinner. Went into Melbourne in the evening & called at the Yorick. There I
met Marcus Clarke & chummed a little with him. We walked home together.
Polly & I not such good friends as we should be to-day. Got however a little
nearer the mark at bed time. Mr Sturt the Visiting Justice was at the Gaol to-day
& it took me some time to accompany him through the Gaol as there were so
many prisoners who wished to speak with him.
February 17 Friday 1871
Another fine day & cool for the time of year. Received a letter from my father
with one enclosed for Harry. The boy was delighted at hearing from his
Grandfather & showed the letter as a matter of course to Jemmy Robertson &
his other immediate friends. This morning there was another horrible death
137 This appears to be the first meeting with Marcus Clarke.
158 Valentine?s Day was widely celebrated. The custom of sending Valentine cards had been
accelerated to a popular pastime by the advent of the postal service, as suggested by
numerous sketches of the time.


in the Gaol from Delirium Tremens. A man named Scott alias Dickens was
brought to the Gaol on Wednesday last charged with Wife desertion. He was
suffering very much from delirium tremens & was placed at once under
treatment. Scott was a powerfully built man & struggled hard for existence. Great
care was taken of him & unless Dr McCrea?s system is a mistake it was not
possible to save his life. He was apparently well to do, had valuable rings on his
fingers & had recently returned from England where he had been to receive some
property. I saw him when dying this morning. He was unconscious but struggled
terribly & seemed to die a very hard death. Drink then Crime, then Destruction,
then Damnation. Go a head bully boys! Who?ll shout!
March 3 Friday 1871
A fine day though cold for the time of year. This was the Election Day for
the second Batch as it is called of Representatives for the Lower House. Polly
went with Darvall to Elsternwick & returned with Darvall about eight
o?clock. We sat talking till nearly eleven & then I went down the street to see
how things had fared with Witt for the Murray Boroughs. Went into
Cartons? to enquire for Forman. Met there Pitman & was very much
disgusted at his taking me to one side & saying he should like to see the next
Flogging. I answered him very sharply that if he wanted to talk to me about
business he was to come to my place of business to do so. Went to the Age
office & heard that Witt had been returned & that Mr Kean & Bowman
were both defeated. Walked up Bourke Street & went into the Oriental
Concert Room to see what it was like. It was extremely properly conducted.
There was some singing on the stage & a number of men sitting at tables
taking Coffee or stronger stimulants & waited upon by demure & ugly girls
mostly dressed in black wearing their dresses buttoned close up to their
throats & looking more like Nuns than gay young ladies. Our curiosity being
satisfied Darvall & I left. Then we went & had some oysters & then
separated. This afternoon after four o?clock I went to the Yorick & played
several games of Cribbage with Wheeler, Mackinlay, Telo & Harrison. The
Club was crowded with members & I had a very good hour?s change.
March 11 Saturday 1871
A fine day. This morning Darvall came up to breakfast & to see if I would
accompany him to Queenscliff. I declined, not being able to get away
without some difficulty & Darvall who went into the Gaol & saw what I had
to do & the number of people who were waiting for me did not press the
matter any further. Mustered in the afternoon then went to the Yorick where
I played a couple of Games of Cribbage, had a little chat & then came home
to tea. In the evening I was tempted to go to the theatre to see a new
Tragedian Mr Howe in Hamlet. This was Mr Howe?s first appearance & I
think he made a mistake in appearing as Hamlet as Montgomery made that
character very difficult for any one else to play after him. One thing satisfactory


to me was that there was certainly no doubt in the mind of Mr Howe that
Hamlet was mad. He played him mad throughout, scarcely giving him a sane
interval. Howe is a little man & grimaces a great deal. His voice is not
unpleasing & he possesses a certain amount of power & ability which however
would in my opinion serve him better in other parts than they do in Hamlet. 159
March 16 Thursday 1871
Another fine day though I awoke feeling very sick & little disposed to enjoy
it. This was the day fixed for the last batch of elections, among which was
that of East Melbourne for which Division I have a vote. Took a turn through
the town after going to the Gaol & seeing the business fairly started there,
just to note what was going on. There seemed a good many people about but
all very quiet & orderly. I took care all the turnkeys had the chance of voting
& in the afternoon after three o?clock went myself to exercise my right of
manhood suffrage. Even when I got into the box with the voting paper in my
hand I was puzzled how to register. First there was Fred Walsh whom I know
personally and rather like, then there was Cohen who I know nothing at all
about but who was running with Walsh & working with him, then there was
Bright a promising literary man & likely if returned to be of service to the
Colony. (There were two other candidates but they were outsiders & not
worth mentioning in the little space I have for my remarks). Now the
question was with me, should I vote as friendship prompted me for Walsh
and give Bright a vote with him or should I vote as asked for Walsh & Cohen,
or should I plump for Bright? To do the first would have been to dummy my
vote. The second I felt was not in accordance with my convictions & so I did
the third. It was of no consequence however. Cohen went in a long way at
the head of the Poll & Walsh was two hundred ahead of Bright so that Cohen
& Walsh were triumphantly returned. At five o?clock went into town with
Polly to see what was going on. Came home to tea. In the evening I went to
the Yorick & had a chat there about the result of the elections. Higinbotham
was turned out at Ballaarat by Bent, a Market Gardener. Cope at Pentridge
by Colonel Champ. Clark a subordinate in the Customs at Williamstown
who resigned his post to contest the election was triumphantly returned for
that place. The noted C.E. Jones or Rogue Jones was beaten at Ballaarat. 160

famous Shakespearean actor, Walter Montgomery. The latter?s Hamlet had been the centre of
major critical controversy in Melbourne in 1867: Harold Love, James Edward Neild:

160 George Higinbotham (1826-1892) was an outstanding Victorian liberal, one-time Attorney-
General and later Chief Justice of Victoria. Thomas Bent (1828-1909) combined politics
with land speculation and was Premier of Victoria 1904-09. Colonel William Champ
(1808-1892) was a one-time Premier ofTasmania (1856-57) and later Inspector-General
of Penal Establishments in Victoria during Castieaus years at Beechworth. Charles Edwin
Jones (1828-1903) was a notorious politician, at one time expelled from the parliament for
corruption, hence the nickname ?Rogue? ( Australian Dictionary of Biography).


March 17 Friday 1871
A very fine day indeed. The Court still continued. I did not however sit in it
long as there was a Bail Case on which lasted the whole of the day. St Patrick?s
Day. Polly took the youngsters into town to see the Procession. 161 They came
home very jolly between two & three o?clock. Mustered an hour earlier than
usual in honor of the Saint. When I came in from Muster I found Mrs
Littlewood with Polly. Littlewood & the youngsters were outside in charge of
the one horse dray in which they had ridden from St Kilda. In the evening I
took it into my head to write a letter to The Ovens and Murray as I began to
think I owed them something for continuing to send me the paper. I wrote
a lot of scribble not of much account I am afraid. However Polly passed it &
I shall send it in due course. Went into town & bought some tobacco, then
came home. Polly had been to see Mrs Smith & had just returned. This
evening I was summoned to the door & informed that a woman had just
died in the hospital. A very simple case as the Coroner would say, a broken
down constitution debilitated by drink & dissipation. Sent to Gaol because
the magistrates must find shelter for such unfortunates or allow them to die
houseless & homeless. There is another woman of just the same stamp dying
in the room in which this woman was living. She was taken out of a house
in which she was lying without friends & unable to take care of herself. She
is sent to Gaol until she can be received into the Benevolent Asylum. Yet they
say there is no necessity for a poor law. 162
March 25 Saturday 1871
A fine day though cloudy. Busy in the Gaol with one thing & another. Went
to The Sheriff?s office but soon made my way to my own desk again. Mr
Sturt the Visiting Justice came to the Gaol a little after twelve o?clock & heard
several Charges against the women. He then went up to the Female Wing
where there were several termagants most anxious to make complaints about
their food & the treatment they received from the officers. I was very firm &
would not yield an inch but told the Visiting Justice the women were not
speaking the truth. As usual odious comparisons were drawn between the
comforts of Pentridge & the Hulks & the discomforts of Melbourne Gaol.
Indirectly also allusions were made to the difference between the Visiting
Justices. The one at Pentridge & the Hulk was a thorough gentleman & so
by the bye were the Superintendents I was told a few days ago. Miss Davidson
161 St Patrick?s Day by this time was celebrated in Melbourne with more equanimity than in
earlier days when it was marred by sectarianism: K.S. Inglis, The Australian Colonists:
An Exploration of Social History, 1788?1870 (Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press,
1974), pp. 86-104.
162 After visiting Australia at this time, the English novelist Anthony Trollope commented on
the absence of a poor law in the colonies, but noting that none were left to fend for
themselves on the streets, a view here contested by Castieau. See Anthony Trollope, Australia ,
edited by P.D. Edwards, and R.B. Joyce (St. Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press,
1967), p. 383; and on the issue in colonial politics and identity see pp. 85-104.


again convinced the Visiting Justice by her tongue & manner that she was a most
unsuitable prison officer & he made a memo, respecting her in his book. The
female prisoners give me a great deal of trouble but after all, considering the
number we have & the limited space, we get on wonderfully well & quietly.
Mustered this afternoon. Joe, Emma, Godfrey & Harry Lotherington had
tea with us. Joe does not know yet what will be done about Burke?s business.
I was sorry however to hear that the Estate was not nearly in so favorable a
condition as was expected it would prove to be. What mushrooms our
wealthy merchants, as they are called, turn out as a rule to be when anything
else than fair weather meets their circumstances. Went into town & read the
Newspapers at the Club. Polly was over at Dr Robertson?s house & stayed
there till past eleven o?clock. The doctor then brought her home. Drank some
toddy, smoked two or three pipes & then went off to bed. Was pleased with
Harry. This evening he read a scene with me from the School for Scandal 163 &
showed a good deal [of] understanding.
Baby had his likeness taken & made a really pretty picture. Polly was taken
holding him on her knee. Her picture is not so good but somehow
Photographers fail with her & make her appear quite unlike what she is in
reality. Having blue eyes must have a good deal to do with it. I would rather
have a colored one of her, though even then I am afraid a Photograph of her
would not satisfy me.
April 6 Thursday 1871
A fine day. Went into Court House in the
morning & saw the Sheriff. Busy in the
Gaol among the women, a number being
brought before me for different offences.
Walford had a quantity of jewellery for
sale which he said had been pledged &
that he had found the money to redeem it
in hope of selling it to advantage for the
owner. I bought a chain for �2 as it rather
took my fancy. If it is what it appears it is
cheap. I wanted a watch chain &C do not
think I have been guilty of any very great
extravagance in purchasing this one to-day
?Richard Warren, Owner of The Ovens
and Murray Advertiser from 1855?

of Victoria, Vol. 3 (Melbourne:
The Cyclopedia Company, 1905)
though of course I could have done without it & would have shown more
wisdom if I had kept my money in my pocket & been contented with my old
chain until money was more plentiful & I better able to spare it. Mustered in
the afternoon. In the evening went to Melbourne & called at the Club where
I had a look at Punch & the other papers & a chat with Telo & Kane &
afterwards another with Carrington of The Illustrated Melbourne News.
163 The play by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, first performed in 1777.


Came home a little after nine o?clock. Polly was away at Dr Robertson?s &
did not come home till eleven o?clock. Mrs Robertson then came over to the
house with her & stayed chatting for some little time. So what with toddy &
smoke after they were gone it was pretty late before we went upstairs to bed.
Dotty & Sissy went to-day to Elsternwick for a holiday & are to stay during
Easter. In conversing with Rider of the Daily Telegraph I happened to speak
about a lecture I had delivered at Beechworth upon Gaol matters in which I
had expressed ideas that were now being expressed by other people as
something new. I said if I could get some notice taken of the Lecture now the
Penal Commission was sitting it might do me good. Ryder said get the
lecture & I?ll notice it. I wrote to Warren asking him to send down the paper
which contains it & if he does I shall avail myself of Ryder?s offer & give it
to him to make any extracts he pleases.
April 15 Saturday 1871
A fine day. ?Alas how fair & foul a day?. Received by Post from Beechworth an
Ovens and Murray containing my lecture, also a letter from Warren telling me
I could keep it as long as I pleased. Mr Sturt visited the Gaol & tried several
Cases. He then went through the Gaol & on leaving entered a highly
complimentary minute of his satisfaction with the appearance & state of the
prison. I felt very pleased & thought myself all was right. Went into the Play-
ground to look after the geese & then went into dinner. Scarcely had I helped
myself when there was an alarm. I went out & found two men had escaped
over the wall. They must have been on the Wall at the time I was in the
Playground. One was caught by the turnkeys, the other could not be heard of.
I felt broken hearted & shed tears of bitter mortification after I had taken the
necessary steps to cause a pursuit. I felt disgusted & prostrate. The Escape
seems to me to have been a most disgraceful one. There was a turnkey on the
Tower, a Post that I had made because of the danger of the Yard. There was
another in the Yard who however had his dinner & was eating it at the time.
Neither man on Platform or Turnkey in the Yard knew anything of the Escape
until their attention was called to it by a prisoner. The men had a rope made
of blankets with an iron hook at the end of it. This they had thrown over the
wall & got fastened in some manner I have not yet been able to discover & then
two of them managed to get on to the wall & over. The rope broke or more of
them would have escaped in the same way. Mustered in the afternoon. In the
evening went to the Club & stayed talking till nearly midnight with Harrison
&Mr Jardine Smith. 164 Polly very good tempered when I got home.
I drank & smoked & went to bed feeling as ?miserable as a Bandicoot?. 165
164 Jardine Smith, one time owner and editor of Melbourne Punch , and also with The Argus.
He appears frequently in Castieau?s Diary.
165 This is an early occurrence of this popular colloquialism, though it had appeared in print
at least as early as 1845: W.S. Ramson (ed.), The Australian National Dictionary:
A Dictionary of Australianisms on Historical Principles (Melbourne, 1988), p. 33.


April 17 Monday 1871
A fine morning. Had plenty to do as my Report of the Escape had to be
written & I had to attend The Supreme Court as the Criminal Sittings were
on. Ellis attended in the afternoon. Heard a preliminary examination of those
who knew anything about the Case & ended in suspending both Asgrove &
McCabe. In the evening I went to the Club & had a long talk with Levey
leaving with him the lecture I delivered some time ago at Beechworth. He
did?ent say he would but I believe he will take notice of it in The Age or some
other paper with which he is connected.
When I came home I found that Polly was away at Dr Robertson?s so
I smoked my pipe & drank my toddy all alone until a ring came at my
particular bell & then on going to answer it I found that two detectives
wished to see me to report the capture of Nixon the man who had got away.
It seems Nixon had hurt his ancle very much on getting down from the wall
but had scarcely felt the pain until he had walked to Sandridge. The
Detectives heard of him in the usual manner. They obtain information by
paying for it directly or indirectly & so Nixon was taken lying under a heap
of bags half starved & with a foot he was unable to put to the ground. Polly
came home about ten o?clock & we went to bed, I having had an extra glass
on the strength of Nixon?s capture.
April 23 Sunday 1871
Got up at usual time. Weather apparently fine. Went to Church in the Gaol
& Polly took the Girls, Harry & Walter to Church. When Polly came home
it was early so we went for a little walk before dinner. On our way we met Dr
& Mrs Robertson. Lucy Morphy came over to our house in the afternoon &
stayed chatting for some considerable time. Mustered & saw all was right in
the Gaol. After tea went into Melbourne & called at the Club. Met a good
many members, among others Gilbee, Semple, Levey & others. Got home by
nine o?clock. Went into the Gaol & stayed for some time with the turnkeys
on duty. When I got back Polly had gone to bed so I sat & read for an hour
& then followed her up stairs. The book I was reading or skimming was
called Blueskin, or the Aventures of Jonathan Wild 166 the great thief taker. It
was taken away from a prisoner in the Gaol & is certainly as mischievous a
work as could possibly gain access to a place of confinement. It describes fully
all sorts of different plans & attempts at Escape made by Jack Sheppard &
others & is just such a book as would fire the imagination of the larrikin class
who evidently consider breaking prison a most heroic exploit & who would as
a rule put up with extra loss of liberty for the glory of appearing in the papers
& being thought ?lads of spirit? by their contemporaries. A report has come in
that Roland Leigh who attempted to escape from the Melbourne Gaol has
166 It is unlikely that this was the correct title of the work, although several books have been
written about this character.


made an attempt also at Pentridge. Leigh is a man who has taken his present
romantic name instead of his known which is Smith. He is anxious for notoriety
& as far as I have learnt his attempt at Pentridge was a hopeless one, that he
knew it & only wanted to do something to be talked about.
April 29 Saturday 1871
Was up very early this morning. Saw the Turnkeys on Parade & then went
through the Gaol to note for myself what was going on. Was busy in the Gaol
with some of the women who were charged with different offences. Dealt
with them & Miss Davidson who as usual was in trouble. Was sent for to the
Sheriff?s office & told that the Chief Secretary was coming to the Gaol at
twelve o?clock. Went back & waited for him. About half past twelve he came
accompanied by Mr Duncan. At Sir James? request I sent for the Sheriff who
soon arrived accompanied by Mr Ellis & we then went altogether to the
scene of the escape. Sir James evidently was inclined to blame all round & let
me have it because I had ordered the closet to be cut down & then had not
seen my orders were carried out. Quin too will evidently get pepper in the
Minute of the Chief Secretary for not having cut the closet down when
ordered. I tried to show the height of the closet had nothing to do with the
Escape but soon found it was advisable to hold my tongue. When I spoke
about the previous escapes in which McCabe figured as the officer on duty at
the time Sir James got very indignant as he had not heard anything about
them & insisted he ought to have been informed so that he might have
known better how to act. Ellis said the Board would not take cognisance of
anything outside of what they had to enquire into. The Chief Secretary said
the Board & the Government were two different things & that the
Government should have been informed. There was then a discussion as to
whether McCabe should be allowed to remain on duty & it was after some
time decided that he should do so until Monday when his case is to be
settled. Did not Muster this afternoon. Went to the Club & walked with
Marcus Clarke so far as our ways went the same. Went into town again in the
evening & purchased the Weekly Papers.
April 30 Sunday 1871
Got up tolerably early. Did not feel very well but managed a pretty good
breakfast. Notwithstanding went into the Gaol & attended Service. There
were a great many prisoners at Service, some two hundred or more. They
were very orderly & well behaved. Went to meet Polly & the youngsters
coming out of Church. Took Godfrey with me. The Church was over rather
sooner than usual so we went for a walk as far as the bridge & then got home
in good time for dinner. Mustered in the afternoon though I did not feel well.
After muster however I was right down seedy & so screwing up my courage
I sent for an emetic & what is more ?-took it. I was not very jolly for an hour


or two you may depend upon it but towards bed time I began to pluck up &
finally wound up the evening with the wing of a chicken & a glass of brandy
& water. I did not go out all the evening & let Polly go first to bed as Miss
Tait was not at home. As soon as she came back I toddled off to bed & soon
was in my wife?s company. There is a great deal of good in an emetic but it
requires some pluck to take one. The wear & tear to the system must I should
think be very great. To-day at times I thought how natural it would be for a
blood vessel to give way or for some other derangement of the organs of the
body to take place while I was straining & striving with the effects of the
nasty smelling little powder that looked so simple but proved so all powerful.
May 1 Monday 1871
The weather during the night was wet & there was some fog & misty rain
during the day. The General Sessions commenced but I only showed myself
there for a short time leaving Quin to do the necessary work while I attended
to more important matters. Received a notice that I was to go to the Chief
Secretary?s office with Ellis to hear the decision of the Government with
regard to McCabe. Saw the Chief Secretary outside the Treasury & he said
Mr Odgers will inform you Mr Castieau, so we went up & Mr Odgers told
us that McCabe was dismissed. Came back to the Gaol & told the turnkey
of the Government?s decision. Went into town & called at the Club, saw
Marcus Clarke who had he said been reading my lecture & which if 1 liked
he would publish. I said I should have no objection so he invited me to dress
it up a bit & then give it him. Mr Clarke thought I might add some fresh
matter but I declined to do this for fear of the Civil Service Regulations, the
lecture was published before these Regulations came into force & therefore
that I could be careless about, but if I wrote anything fresh I might be called
to account, as I was, about Dunedin & the prisoners work at that place.
Walked part of the way home with Jardon [i.e. Jardine] Smith & Marcus
Clarke. In the evening went into the Gaol & wrote up my Diary. There was
a little hubbub in the Gaol, some of the long sentenced men being inclined
to play up. I punished one & the others were then quiet. Cuthbert came up
& stayed the evening. Polly went to Mrs Smith?s but returned before
Cuthbert went away.
May 2 Tuesday 1871
A very fine day indeed. The General Sessions continued. Was employed at
ordinary work during the day. Went in the morning to call upon Mr
Anderson who has succeeded Drury at the Police Court. On the way met
Drury with a gentleman & said Ah I was going to abuse your successor, ?hush?
said Drury & then introduced me to his companion who proved to be the
veritable Anderson himself. Anderson & I however soon squared matters &
settled the business I had in hand very comfortably. Mustered in the afternoon &


then went to the Club. While there met Marcus Clarke & came away home. On
the road Clarke asked me to dine with him & I accepted his invitation. On the
road home we were attracted by some bonbons at a shilling a box. They were the
new kind lately introduced, each containing a piece of wearing apparel. Clarke &
I both purchased a box. Called in at my house & told Polly I was going home
with Clarke. Clarke lives very near the University. Mrs Clarke was Marion Dunn
a great favorite with the theatre going public. 167 She has settled down from the
favorite actress into the domesticated wife & mother & is apparently very quiet.
Clarke & I saw very little of her except at dinner & at the end of the evening. I
spent a pleasant evening with my host & left about eleven o?clock. Got home &
found Polly had had a visitor, Mrs Robertson who had not long gone away.
May 6 Saturday 1871
Weather looked cloudy in the morning & in the evening there was a heavy
shower. Went to the Sheriffs office in the morning & had a talk to Mr Wright
about my own position. Have serious intentions of applying for more pay in
consequence of my increased duties but have to think which will be the best
way to set to work to ensure success. Hardly know whether it would be best to
apply to the Government or to get my Case put forward in parliament.
Mustered & then went into Melbourne & called at the Club where I met
Marcus Clarke. He came home with me as he wanted to get a cheque cashed
& I offered to do it for him. Harry asked him to write him a pantomime &
he agreed to do so as soon as Harry determined on the subject. Clarke seems
a nice fellow & Polly likes his manner very much indeed.
In the evening Polly & I went into town & had a stroll through Bourke
Street. The Leader of to-day publishes as a supplement the portraits of all the
Members of the Lower House. As a whole the likenesses are good. Kerfcrd for
one however is not flattered but is given a much harder expression than he has
& so made to look anything but an agreeable character. I purchased
Australasian & Leader , some little books for the youngsters & some apples to
make sauce for a goose which Polly caused to be killed for to-morrow?s dinner.
Little things mount up & these kind of expenses show very well how our
money goes. 1/-Papers l/-Books 1/-Apples & Matches make 3/-; 2/6 for Polly
this morning 3/6 & yet it does not appear to be anything for the money.
May 7 Sunday 1871
Weather very wet. No Church of England Service held in the Gaol in
consequence, went into the Gaol & wrote up my Diary, also a letter to the Chief
Secretary asking for an allowance in consequence of the increased duties
devolving upon me from the Pentridge women being kept in the Gaol. Was
very unwell from a cough & cold. Harry unwell also from a similar cause.
167 Marian Dunn, actress on the Melbourne and colonial stage, daughter of John Dunn,
the Irish comic actor: Brain Elliott, Marcus Clarke (Oxford, 1952), pp. 131-137.


Had a goose for dinner which proved a great success. Mustered in the
afternoon. After Muster went to Kew & saw Kerferd. Mrs Kerferd in a little
trouble for want of a servant, the one Polly had engaged for her not having
put in an appearance. Had a long chat. Kerferd thought it inadvisable for me
at present to apply to the Government as he doubted much its stability &
thought if McCulloch chose to be nasty he would put such a minute on my
application as would injure me with any future ministry who would be
inclined to do me service. I said I should act on his opinion unless Duncan
& McCrea to whom I would speak thought it advisable for me to persist in
my application.
In the train returning to Melbourne I met Levey & occupied a seat in the
same carriage. At Melbourne I ran across Hall & walked with him to the
Railway Station. His wife is to come home on Saturday next. Went to the
Club where I saw Dr Maloney who was then the only occupant of the Club
rooms. Did not stop long but came home & soon after went to bed.
May 20 Saturday 1871
A fine morning. Got up early & went on Parade, then took the little girls to
the market. Saw there Mrs Edwards, bought some onions & herbs & had a
good look at all the things else for sale & then came home to breakfast.
Went to the Court, there were some prisoners for sentence & as soon as
Judge Barry had got through that duty the Court came to an end. One
woman who was asked if she had anything to say began to cry & said she
really was not guilty. The learned & courteous Judge remarked ?Dry your eyes
Madam & go to Gaol for 18 months with hard labor?. This created a little
titter in the Court but the unfortunate woman did?ent appear to see the fun
of the observation.
Was busy transacting ordinary business but in the afternoon considered I
had done enough for the week so instead of Mustering I went into town &
played cribbage at the Yorick with Mr Wyatt, McKinlay & Armsinck. Had
some very good games & came away neither better nor worse in pocket. Got
home in time for tea. In the evening sat till nearly nine reading then took
Polly into town to buy some buttons. Got them, purchased The Australasian
& came home, then soon after went to bed. Polly has been all day very busy
making a new silk dress for herself & some waterproofs for the little girls.
Posted my English letters & newspapers. Dr McCrea?s little girl came into the
house while her father paid his Gaol visit. Harry, Sissy & Dotty commenced
learning dancing at Hockings. Polly took them to school.
May 21 Sunday 1871
A fine morning. Bother the first thing this morning in the women?s Gaol, the
hominy being complained about. Complaint apparently made for the sake of
complaining as the meal was sweet & good though a little thin. Guessed the
reason of the grumble to be spite of Kate Laurence & a few other would be


leaders, because yesterday a prisoner on the male side who has been
trafficking with the women, sending them letters &c was caught & punished.
Took Polly, Harry, Sissy & Dotty to church. After Muster stayed at home
till tea time talking with Mrs Dr Robertson who came across to see Mrs
Castieau & the children. In the evening went to the Yorick where I read some
of the papers & had a chat with Telo & a friend concerning the Opera & the
management. Came home by nine o?clock & chatted with Polly till Miss Tait
came home after which we did not stay long before we went to bed.
Harry & baby very much better & my cold also greatly improved. Weather
no doubt has a good deal to do with the health of folk just now. Polly went
away very grandly to Church to-day having a new silk dress & a velvet
mantle. She evidently was very proud of her attire & with some reason as
both garments fitted well & were of home manufacture. The little girls also
were clad in new waterproofs & made a very creditable appearance. Where is
the money to come from that must be expended if they and their brothers are
to make a decent appearance for the future? They have a good mother which
is half the battle, long may she be spared for her labor of love.
May 25 Thursday 1871
Weather cloudy but not wet. Had rather a fishy feeling this morning & not
at all a pleasant one to have while doing business. Had some men in the
Garden this morning & after putting in some cauliflowers & cabbage plants
sent them into the Playground to sow the blank places in the Croquet
Ground. Went to the Sheriff?s office & while there met Mr Blair the
Secretary of the Penal Commission. He took me on one side & said he had
something sensational to communicate & would I walk with him a little way?
I did so & he told me the Penal Commission had sent in their Report & that
they had recommended great changes, in fact some changes that would effect
quite a Revolution in the present Gaol system. The Melbourne Gaol, Present
Court house &c to be razed to the ground & the site sold. The only Gaol to
be in Melbourne they propose to erect in the vicinity of the Law Courts. It
is however intended to be only a very small affair & for prisoners on remand
& waiting trial mostly. At Pentridge there is to be the Penitentiary & a new
building to be called The House of Correction. To this House of Correction
all sentenced prisoners under three years are to be sent, not only from
Melbourne but from all parts of the Colony, the present Gaol being reduced
to small establishments of little more importance than Lock Ups. Mr Blair
said he told me all this in friendship & that my plan would be to look out
for the appointment of Governor of the House of Correction. I said I was
much obliged to him but that I thought the Penal Commission had not
treated me fairly in not examining me. Some excuse was made. Mr Blair & I
by this time had got to his office & he showed me some of the Report, but
just as we were getting into it, the Chief Secretary sent for Mr Blair & he had
to leave asking me to call again to-morrow. I saw the suggestions I made &


which Ellis promised should be sent in as mine, were carefully put away &
credited as the personal experiences of Mr Ellis the Acting Sheriff. I told Blair
they were written by me. Met McLeod, a man who had been a lucky digger
at one time at Beechworth. He told me he was starting for the diamond
fields. I wished him luck. Met Mr Sturt & was very glad to see he was about
again. Did not Muster but went to the Yorick & played cribbage with
McKinlay & Telo. Came home, felt unwell & went early to bed.
May 31 Wednesday 1871
Have neglected my Diary for four days & am now trying to make it up on
Sunday instead of Thursday as I properly should. Was in the Gaol but hardly
know how I was occupied. Played cards with McKinlay this afternoon & won
two games of Cribbage. Marcus Clarke showed me the article that he had
inserted in The Australian Journal & which was taken from the Lecture I
delivered at Beechworth some years ago. I was annoyed to find that Mr Clarke
had not stated this was the case & that consequently the article appeared as if
it was something new & original. This is very awkward because the Penal
Commission have just issued their Report & it would appear as if I was striving
to rival them in the remarks they make upon Penal Discipline. The Penal
Report proposes tremendous changes, the clearing away the present Melbourne
Gaol, the Building a House of Correction at Pentridge & the doing way with
Up Country Gaols as Establishments for anything beyond keeping prisoners
waiting trial or under very short sentences. There is a great deal in the Report
that will not be carried into effect without a great deal of Argument & I fancy
it will be some time before the public will see the advisability of destroying
what has cost so much money unless the results aimed at are more certain of
being realised than appears to be made certain by the Report.
June 15 Thursday 1871
Weather fine, my cough certainly not so bad, though of course it is even yet
far from well. Received a letter from Edwin Smith acknowledging receipt of
the cheque but not saying anything with regard to the remarks I made
concerning his own income. This was the first day of the Criminal Sittings
& I went therefore into Court, did not however stop very long but after
coming to the Gaol went into town where I went to Gemmell & Tuckett?s 168
to pay for the things Polly & I purchased the other day at Hawthorn. The
Account was not ready so I did not setde it but went to the Mart where a lot
of Japanese goods were being sold. 169 They were apparently of a useless
description & not particularly of an ornamental character either. However be
168 Gemmell, Tuckett & Co., Auctioneers at 49 Collins Street.
169 An aspect of the Western phenomenon of japonisme. Japanese decorative items were
popular in the colonies at this time. See Alison Broinowski, The Yellow Lady: Australian
Impressions of Asia (Melbourne: Oxford University Press,l992), pp. 16-17.


that as it may I found myself the possessor of two little tea-pots & three small
cups. After this there were some books disposed of. There was Professor Owens
Work on Dentalogy in two volumes, very well bound & said to have been
published at five guineas. I thought it would do for Dr Robertson or Townsend
& so bought it as it only fetched 10/-. Then there was a little book nicely
bound called a translation of Japanese Odes, 170 this was knocked down to me
at 3/6. I came away feeling like a fool & that I ought not to be trusted alone at
an Auction. A muzzle would be of no use for a nod or a wink suits Gemmell
just as well as a spoken bid. I shall not let Polly know at present of my purchases
to-day but bring them out by degrees & when the soreness of their expense is
somewhat healed. Polly went to Elsternwick to-day. Nelly has come from
Geelong & has taken a house near to Dotty. Johnny went with Polly. Did not
go out after I came from the auction. Played Bezique in the evening.
June 17 Saturday 1871
Weather tolerably fine. Cold better but still very troublesome. It is now more
sore nose & dirty handkerchief than anything else & those nasty &
disagreeable as they are seem preferable to cough & painful chest. Dr
Robertson came over to see Polly about the meat & gladly took the book on
teeth I purchased at Gemmell?s rooms the other day. Found enough to occupy
me in the Gaol office till dinner time. After dinner Polly took the youngsters
to Dancing School & I stayed at home till Muster time. At Muster had a little
disturbance with a woman I had been obliged to punish. Received a fair
quantum of abuse & bore it philosophically. Stayed at home till Polly came
back to tea. Began talking about the prison servants who are a constant source
of anxiety to us although they behave remarkably well. I was unjust to Polly
accusing her of being careless with regard to them. She fired up in return &
each showed the obstinacy of their disposition. Consequently there was no
more peace for this day. I had promised to take the Youngsters to the Market
this evening & they all looked forward to it very eagerly. As it was, their
mother would?ent ask me to go & took them by herself. I waited at home till
the plaguy servants were locked up then went into town. Tried there to meet
Polly & the youngsters & having failed to do so went to the Club. There I
glanced over the Weeklies & then came home. Smoked in sullen silence till
Polly went to bed. Puffed away for an hour after she had gone & then could
do nothing better I found out than follow her & take my place at her side.
June 18 Sunday 1871
Weather tolerably fine till the evening when it clouded over & rained a little.
Got up bad tempered & was sulky with Polly all day. Polly took the
youngsters to Church. I stayed at home, wrote a page in my Diary &
170 The first translation of Japanese poetry into English. Hyak nin is'shiu, or Stanzas by a Century
of Poets ... translated ... by F.V. Dickins (London: Smith, Elder, 1866).


dispatched a number of prisoners letters. In the afternoon mustered, after tea
went to St John?s Church. Came out a little after eight o?clock & went to the
Club where I met Dr Avent & had a chat, then walked with him as far as Dr
Tracey?s House. Avent went into the doctor?s & I came home, had a pipe &
when Miss Tait came home at ten o?clock went to bed. Was very unkind all
day to Polly & feel ashamed of being so for she is truly a good wife & mother.
The only thing is in our difficulties we both are much to blame in persisting
to irritate the sore instead of one or other of us trying to heal by saying a kind
word instead of a cross one & so magnifying the mischief & verily making a
mountain out [of] what in nine cases out of ten is really a molehill.
June 27 Tuesday 1871
Tuesday weather very fine till the evening when it came on windy & was very
boisterous. Was busy in the Gaol with one thing & another. Went however
into the Sheriff?s office & had a chat with Walford who seems in good form
& expectant of something good as he has friends who have friends in the
Ministry. Mustered in the afternoon & then went to the Yorick where I
played cribbage till tea time. In the evening I amused myself with reading
while Polly amused or instructed herself at the piano. Towards the end of the
evening spouted a little for Harry?s amusement & then let him off to bed.
Baby is a great nuisance of nights now. He wakes up inclined to play & will
not go to sleep however much he may be coaxed or threatened. I should think
we were awake some hours from this unreasonable conduct of ?the dear little
pet? to-night. Miss Tait was away again to-day.
Have been feeling queer again, troubled mostly with a disagreeable watery
taste in my mouth & inability to taste anything else but water.
My palate seems entirely to have lost its cunning & everything I eat seems to
have but one flavour & that a watery one. I have also been troubled with
something that must be very like itch as far as feeling goes for I have been
inclined to scratch myself continually for these two or three days past. I
suppose the fact is I want a change.
July 1 Saturday 1871
Weather tolerably fine. This was Separation day & was of course kept as a
holiday in the Sheriff?s office. The Visiting Justice attended at the Gaol &
spent some considerable time in trying prisoners & hearing requests. In the
afternoon as I had been all through the Gaol with the Visiting Justice I did
not Muster but went to the Yorick where I played some cribbage with Semple
& Duerdin. 171 In the evening attended the Annual Meeting of the Yorick.
There was a great deal of talk & comparatively speaking very little business
transacted. It was proposed to have a President & Vice President but
171 James Duerdin, solicitor at 105 Collins Street, a frequent associate of Castieau.


this proposal met with a great deal of opposition & the motion proposing the
officers was negatived. I voted against it not because I objected to having a
President or Vice President but because I saw there were a large number of
the members who did object & I thought the election if it came off would
only breed ill-feeling in the Club. After this motion was lost there were some
others of less interest carried & then came the balloting for the Committee.
A good deal of interest was taken in this & a good deal of noisy fun while the
ballot was progressing. Eventually a very good Committee was elected. The
Rev. Dr Bleasdale was in a most anxious state for supper & made a few
remarks which were not very intelligible nor yet much to the point. He was
annoyed at the phrase Democracy being used towards the Club & said The
Yorick should fly high & consider themselves ?The Aristocracy of talent?. The
Doctor?s observations fell flat & we saw little more of him during the evening
though he had with much liberality covered the table with Colonial Wine &
for which I regret to say no one who partook of it was grateful enough to
express any thanks. 172 We made a great noise but had very little real fun. Did
not get home till tolerably late in the morning [evening?].
July 2 Sunday 1871
Felt rather otherwise than bright this morning & had the unhappy
consciousness of having taken more wine last night than was good for me.
Did not go to Church. Polly however took the youngsters & Madeline
Kerferd who came yesterday to stay a few days with Sissy & Dotty. After
dinner I proposed we should all go out & thought of Brighton. Polly was
very glad of an outing & made arrangements for the servants to go inside
& for the female officers to look after the young children. We all started for
the Railway Station. On the Road bought an Extraordinary which was
published this morning, the English Mail having arrived in the night.
There was terrible news of the Civil War in Paris, of the murder of the
Archbishop, two other clergymen & 64 hostages by the Insurgents & of the
fearful retaliation of the troops, 30,000 of the Reds being said to be killed
or wounded in the Streets. Some of the finest buildings in Paris were
wilfully set fire to by the insurgents & women were shot by the infuriated
soldiers while they (the women) were like fiends rushing about
endeavouring to set light to anything that could be consumed. Only the
Telegraphic Message has yet been received but it would appear Marshal
McMahon 173 has put an end to the rebellion for a time at any rate & that
172 John Ignatius Bleasdale (1822-1884), an English-born Catholic priest who had begun his
clerical studies in Lisbon, was a well-known advocate of colonial science and industry,
including wine (Australian Dictionary of Biography).
173 Marshal MacMahon, the French military leader originally appointed Governor of Algeria
by Napoleon III; he suppressed the revolutionary Commune of Paris in 1871, following
French defeat in the Franco-Prussian war. The war was the subject of numerous entries
in Castieau?s diary during this year.


the ?Red? Party is morally extinct. A good effect but purchased with
frightful carnage. What the Government of the French will be like until the
next Revolution it is at present difficult to say.
Arrived at Brighton & went to Bell?s house. He was not at home. The
housekeeper however gave us some biscuits & wine & we made ourselves
comfortable till it was time to see about getting home. Then we had a run
upon the Beach & then a walk to the Railway Station. When we got to
Melbourne we took the Bus & got home in good time for tea. Went early to
bed as I had a head ache & felt knocked up.
July 3 Monday 1871
A fine morning & a tolerably fine day though cloudy at times. Went to the
Sheriff?s office where I learnt that Miss Davidson was to Resign or be
dismissed. 174 The Sheriff afterwards came to the Gaol & told her of the
decision of the Government. Miss Davidson could not of course understand
what was meant for a long time but eventually she decided upon sending her
Resignation which I duly received. After Muster went to the Yorick where I
saw Mr Walsh who it is said is to be the Attorney General. He is a barrister
at Ballaarat & is a Country Member of our Club. At Polly?s request I took her
to the Theatre Royal this evening to see the new Play by Boucicault of Elfie
or The Cherry Tree Inn. m Master George Coppin has been guilty of a little
dodge in bringing out this Piece for he leads people by his advertisements to
believe the Piece is quite original as he makes the Author dedicate it to
Australia & express his gratification at having a Play of his brought out in
Melbourne before London. The fact is Elfie was produced at Edinburgh or
Glasgow & why not in London I cannot tell unless it did?ent prove a success
in Scotland. The House to-night was miserably cold. We sat in the Stalls &
there is evidently a great draught there from the back of the Stage as when a
deep scene was set we always felt the air more chilly than when the scene only
occupied the front part of the Stage. Elfie is a slow Play. There are two or
three good positions in it but they do not compensate for the endurance of a
great lot of twaddle that is introduced between them. A Mr Shafto Robinson
made his bow in Elfie to a Melbourne Public. He is gentlemanly looking but
does not appear to have done much Professional work. I should imagine him
as a favorite among Amateurs. When he has had a little more experience of
the Stage I fancy he will do very well.
July 6 Thursday 1871
Got up this morning at half past six & went through the Gaol & saw that all
was apparrently going on well. The Inquest on James Dow was held to-day
174 Following a disciplinary hearing. Davidson had many times been the subject of complaint
by prisoners and staff for her abusive behaviour.
175 Dion Boucicault (1822?1890) was a celebrated Irish-born dramatist.


by Dr Candler. 176 The Jury was very much inclined to be troublesome &to
find fault with Dr McCrea?s treatment of Delirium Tremens & would if they
could have managed it implied grave censure on the doctor in their verdict.
As it was however they simply brought in a verdict ?That death was caused
from the effects of drink?. There is certain to be a bother some day about Dr
McCrea?s treatment of Delirium Tremens. It seems to me really killing
treatment for emetics, cold effusions & leeches bring the men so low that it
is impossible to rally their systems again sufficiently to cause their recovery.
Dow when he was brought to the Gaol was a strong able bodied man full of
life & very violent. He had an emetic, then cold effusion, then two dozen
leeches, then two dozen more & then two dozen again. To keep him quiet he
was sewn up in a blanket which is itself terribly reducing as it creates profuse
perspiration. After this no wonder Dow was quiet & got so alarmingly weak
that the doctor had to order him injections of essence of beef & to dose him
with brandy every two or three hours & this till he died. The last few days
the doctor was evidently trying to undo all he had done when the patient first
came under his charge.
July 7 Friday 1871
A rather raw & gloomy morning. Polly was very unwell during the night
suffering severely from windy spasms. I sent away Edwin Smith?s Chain in a
Registered letter & hope he will get it safe. Attended at a Sale of Books
advertised to belong to the Late Hon W.C. Haines. 177 There were however
some books that evidently had come from another place. These were more
modern & I purchased a number of lots which cost me altogether �9.0.6. 178
Polly who is generally disposed to be critical of my Auction purchases was
pleased with the Books. She went to Gemmell?s where I bought them &
brought them away home. They made our Book Case look quite respectable.
Amongst other books I got a nice Edition of the Lady of the Lake, Moore?s
Poems, Wordsworth?s, Scott?s, Hood?s, Byron?s & Southey & Coleridge?s. Then
the original edition of Macaulay?s History of England. Seven volumes of Good
Words, Many Thoughts of Many Minds, Arabian Nights, Gil Bias, Don Quixote
& in fact between sixty & seventy volumes altogether & at prices that
averaged the whole at 3/- per Volume.
Mrs Kerferd had her lunch with us to-day & wanted Polly to go out with
her but Polly would not do that as she wished to stop at home & take her
Music Lesson as Miss Masters her teacher put in an appearance just as Mrs
Kerferd was ready to go away.
176 Curtis Candler (1827-1911), one of the two Melbourne coroners. Although Castieau refers to
him as doctor, Candler only had an apothecary?s licence which led to him withdrawing from
medical practice in 1863. Simon Cooke, ?Secret Sorrows: A Social History of Suicide in Victoria,
1841?1921? (PhD, University of Melbourne, 1998), pp. 58-60.
177 William Clarke Haines (1810-1866), the first premier ofVictoria.
178 More than a week?s salary, which at this time was �32 per month.


Mustered in the afternoon, then went to the Club & read the Evening
Paper. I left my cane at the Club some three nights since & was annoyed to-
day at not being able to find it. I do not feel quite certain but that some one
belonging to the Club has put it away in joke and so shall wait a while. If I
find it has been stolen I shall make a little bother about it. Came home to tea
& had a good look at the books I purchased to-day. Afterwards played
Bezique with Polly until the Spasms got too much for her. Then she went to
bed & after I had smoked a pipe or two I went likewise. In the middle of the
night was called up, an old woman having died in Hospital.
July 9 Sunday 1871
Weather tolerably fine though inclined to be showery. Polly passed a bad night
& was not disposed to get up this morning so I took the little girls & Sissy to
Church. Harry was barking away so we left him at home. A Minister officiated
this morning with whom I am unacquainted. He was not a very pleasing reader
but preached an excellent sermon. Felt very unequal to any kind of exertion &
troubled with a general fit of despondency. All things seemed to me to look very
blue & my debts & difficulties stretched themselves into monstrous
proportions. I do not know what is the matter with me but the cloud that hangs
over my existence is darker & gloomier every day & if not dispersed by some
lucky breeze will ere long enshroud me altogether. Funny dreams have made any
sleep uneasy for some time back. For the last two nights I have dreamt I was
trying to swim to America & each time have started to perform the arduous feat
though all the while I felt a weariness & loss of energy which assured me I must
fail in my enterprise. Each night I have seemed to struggle my best & each night
I have had to give in beaten & exhausted. My dream went no further so what
became of my body tossing on the waves I cannot relate, but on each occasion
I have woke as weary & exhausted as if in reality I had been battling with the
elements instead of simpling dreaming such to be the case. Mustered in the
afternoon & spent the evening reading & disagreeing. Polly was unwell & out
of temper & I was snappish so we growled. I said very hard & disagreeable
things & then the pair of us amused ourselves & not one another. Very stupid
work too. Wrote a page in my Diary & commenced a letter to The Ovens and
Murray. Smoked a pipe & got to bed by about eleven o?clock.
July 10 Monday 1871
Weather fine. Busy in the Gaol during the morning & attending the County
Court to which I was subpoenaed as a witness. My temper was not improved
by the receipt of a Bill of Costs from Kidston for what he did in the Portia
business. 179 It seems he consulted Dr McKay whose Fee & Clerks amounted to
�2.9.6, to this Kidston added 30/- which made �4.0.6.1 am called upon to pay,
?Oh beware of law?.
179 Litigation involving the Portia Mining Company in which Castieau had invested.


A very sensational story might have been made out of an incident that occurred
in the Gaol. It might have been written in this style. ?A Woman immured in the
dungeons of the Melbourne Gaol for four years without warrant & for no
offence.? Our readers will be startled by this announcement but it is no less true
than starding. Jessie Walker was arrested in April 1867 for Having no visible
means of Support. She was remanded for a week & then again for another week.
After that there is no record of her having been dealt with by the authorities;
notwithstanding she remained incarcerated until her death, which took place at
two am on Saturday. A searching investigation is required into this case & if
blame is attached to any one whatever his position may be, we trust nothing will
be allowed to interfere with the certainty or rapidity of his punishment. Our
Reporter viewed the body & found it to be little more than a bag of bones. Until
after the Inquest however it would not be fair to express an opinion as to whether
this was caused by long & rigorous imprisonment or natural decay.
Yes that is all quite correct but very easily explained. A poor old woman nearly
eighty years of age was found destitute in the Bush & brought to Melbourne by
the Police. The Magistrates to give her shelter remanded her to the Melbourne
Gaol & efforts were then made without success to obtain her admission into the
Benevolent Asylum. Thoroughly childish & helpless old Granny as she was called
had to remain in the Gaol. She was put in the Hospital & was most kindly looked
after, after a time becoming a sort of Institution in the place. When I took charge
1 tried to get her removed to the Benevolent Asylum but failed & so Jessie stayed
with us till she died. She was very thin but as she was over eighty years of age that
is not much to be wondered at. The Jury evidendy were perfecdy satisfied justice
had been done to her & brought in a verdict of?Death from Old Age?.
Mustered this afternoon & then went to the Yorick where I had a chat with
Telo & others & then came home to tea. In the evening took the youngsters to
see the Torch light procession which had been advertised to walk to the Eastern
Market as a protestation of the people?s joy at the advent of the Duffy Ministry. 180
It was a very poor affair, not above fifty torches altogether & these carried by
noisy larrikins who capered about led by a band nearly all drums & followed by
a crowd not of the procession but simply in the street to see what was the
?davarshun? [diversion?]. Did?ent go far enough to know whether there were any
speeches made at the Market but took the children home & then after some
toddy & a pipe went to bed.
July 11 Tuesday 1871
Weather fine & pleasant. Attended in the female gaol & had the usual bother
with some of the women I had to punish. One excitable little witch
attempted or pretended to attempt to throw herself down a flight of stairs.
She was easily managed however & I ordered her to be restrained by a strait
waistcoat until she could be seen by the doctor. The next Case was
180 Charles Gavan Duffy (1816-1903), a Young Irelander, Premier of Victoria.


however a more serious one for the woman was a strapping virago big enough
to swallow a little fellow like me & to knock the delicate damsels I have as
attendants about like ninepins. As soon as I gave her her sentence ?two days
solitary confinement? she commenced abusing me & to look very
threatening. From this she got spiteful & would?ent go into a cell. I thought
there would be mischief so sent up for a couple of turnkeys from the Male
Wing. They did not come however & the female officers managed the
woman themselves. I was very savage at the men not coming & when I made
enquiry ?Buck? who was on duty in the Corridor & the only officer there
excused himself for having no one to send & for being a cripple. I roared at
him & told him I wanted no cripples about the Place. Then I spoke savagely
to Quin & after all the officers were not to blame. There are two absent & it
was true Buck was the only man in the Corridor, Quin being away on
reasonable business. Buck too had hurt his leg in the Labor Yard while
rushing to secure a parcel of tobacco that had been thrown over the Wall to
the prisoners. Cooling down I sent for Quin & Buck, heard their
explanations & exonerated them from all blame in the matter.
August 20 Sunday 1871
Polly in a very low way. She certainly is not well & seems most anxious for a
change. 1 told her she could go & it would be better for her to go quickly.
The money question then of course had to be gone into & very blue our
circumstances appear when financially looked into. Polly began to preach at
my wickedness & extravagance & I got tired & cowardly, tried to hook it to
bed. She followed me however & gave me one or two last words which made
me kick & use abusive language. I am sorry to record this but a Diary to be
useful must be truthful. Thought of Insuring my Life & borrowing money
upon the Policy. Hinted to Polly that Bell might be a surety for me were he
asked to be so. Polly did not seem to like the idea of troubling Bell.
August 21 Monday 1871
Weather tolerably fine to-day. Had some men doing up the garden. Polly not
very well & seems to have fully made up her mind it is necessary she should
go away & have a change. Was busy writing in the Gaol Office all the
morning. In the afternoon the Visiting Justice paid a visit & tried some
women for various offences. Two charges I brought against women for
endeavouring to communicate with the male prisoners were very leniently
treated, one women who pleaded guilty being simply cautioned & the case
against the other being dismissed as Mr Sturt considered the evidence
insufficient. Of course I do not carp at the Magistrate?s decisions though I
certainly thought the Case was a good one. It is hard to get even visiting
Justices to understand Gaol offences. The charges brought against prisoners
frequently appear trumpery, as no doubt they would be out of doors, though


they are grave infractions of discipline in Gaol & if allowed would soon put
an end to the good government of the prison. Two young fellows were
flogged this afternoon, there was the usual little knot of connossieurs
gathered together to see the sport.
August 22 Tuesday 1871
Weather cloudy. Julia 181 taken very unwell & hysterical. Polly in a bad
way herself & every thing as a rule most uncomfortable. Received a
notification that Mr Duffy intended visiting the Gaol to-day. Stopped at the
Gaol to be in readiness to receive him. He came at about half past twelve
accompanied by a seedy looking old coon who I afterwards found out was
Judge Bindon. Mr Wright, the Sheriff, went with us through the Gaol. Mr
Duffy was very pleasant in his manner & seemed most anxious to say
everything that was fair. He undertook to take notice of any suggestions I
might choose to make in writing & promised to adopt them if he considered
it would be advisable to do so. He said I must have a great deal of experience
& if I proposed any changes in the Gaol management that would tend to
make the establishment self-supporting I should receive substantial advantage.
After the Chief Secretary?s visit 1 was not much inclined for work &
foolishly went in for brandy & no dinner. This did not benefit me very
much. In the afternoon went to the Yorick where I met Poole, sub-editor of
The Age, who took me into the House with him. Met Judge Cope who was
sitting in the Council?s seats when I was shown in by Poole. Kerferd saw us
& asked Cope & 1 to have some tea with him which we accordingly did.
After tea went again into the House & heard McCulloch pitch into Berry for
the Speech he had made at Geelong in which he said the McCulloch
Ministry had borrowed two millions of money at 5 per cent & lent it to the
Banks at 2 per cent. Saw Witt with whom I chummed for the rest of the
evening. Got home very late. Saw Mr & Mrs Gregory at the House. They
invited me to bring the children to see them.
August 23 Wednesday 1871
Was at the Treasury where I met Hall.
Weather tolerably fine. Got up feeling rather seedy, went into the Gaol
Office. Seven fellows were brought before me for idleness. I punished them
all. One of them immediately sprang at the Overseer of Labor & gave him a
crack in the nose. I jumped up & knocked the fellow down. The others
remained passive. Went to the Sheriff?s Office & had a long chat with the
Sheriff about the Chief Secretary & his remarks during the visit of yesterday.
Felt queer & unsettled & was hanging about all the afternoon till Muster
time. Talking of hanging about, there was a man to-day went in for hanging
181 Their house servant.


himself or else made a very good pretence at so doing; he had tied his neck
tie on to the iron gate of his cell & then put his head into a noose he had
made at the end of the handkerchief. This took his feet a little of[f] the
ground in which condition he was found by turnkey Capper on a visit that
officer made to his cell. Capper & Rowley both say the fellow was nearly
gone when fortunately he was so discovered. I think he meant to gammon 182
but made a mistake & went a little further than he expected or anticipated.
After Muster went to The Yorick & remained there chatting with Telo,
Marcus Clarke, Levey, Wyatt & one or two others. Came home about half past
seven with Marcus Clarke. Julia was said to be a little better. She had had a
composing draught & it had done her good. Polly very unwell. She hardly
knows yet whether she will be able to go away as she proposes. The Littlewoods
are to start on Friday so if she does go she will accompany them. Was at the
Police Court this morning to give evidence against a young fellow charged with
endeavouring to introduce tobacco into the Gaol.
August 24 Thursday 1871
Weather windy & consequently dusty, not at all agreeable or suitable for Polly
who was out in the morning getting things for her proposed trip up country on
Friday. With regard to this trip I am very much afraid it will not turn out well.
The children are so much responsibility & take so much looking after, the prison
servants who require some one to be looking after them always, the awkwardness
of the accommodation in many respects all help to make taking charge of the
house a difficult task & I question very much whether Julia however willing she
may prove will be equal to it. Of course if she is ill the thing will be settled at
once, however there is no doubt Polly is very unwell & that her illness is getting
serious. The change will I trust benefit her. If it does, any worry, bother or anxiety
there may be at home will be amply compensated when she returns again able to
go in heartily & perform without trouble her duties to the children & myself. I
have not been in good spirits to-day. Polly?s miserable face seems to reproach &
make me irritable while the noise or even the sight of the children is a nuisance.
This morning a young woman was brought to the Gaol for deserting her
child. It appears that yesterday feeling her trouble coming she went away
from the house where she was at service, laid down in a stable & shortly after
the baby was born got up & left it & returned to her work. The constable
found her at her place & at her work this morning. The baby has since died.
Mustered in the afternoon. After Muster went to the Club where I had a
talk with Duerdin about a Quartz Company that Witt wished me to join.
Duerdin thought well of the Prospectus & I left it with him to make some
enquiries concerning the subject of it. When I came home to tea I found
Lucy & Katey Morphy who had come over to say good bye to Polly. Polly
was out so Lucy promised to call again in the morning.
182 Used here in the sense 'to pretend'.


Played Bezique in the evening. Polly overcome before bed-time, got a low fit
& cried, which as usual, for I hate to see her crying, made me vicious.
August 25 Friday 1871
Weather much the same as yesterday. House in a great state of bustle as Polly
was preparing for going away. The poor woman looked very ill & miserable
& I felt anything but comfortable at her appearance. It seemed to reproach
me & yet perhaps I have been as much sinned against as sinning. I hope most
earnestly the change will do Polly good & bring her home to me all right
again. Took a cab & went with Polly to the Railway Station where we soon
found Mr & Mrs Littlewood. Got a very nice compartment in one of the
carriages which the three had all to themselves when they left Melbourne.
August 30 Wednesday 1871
Begin to feel a blank in the house now Polly is away & was right glad to
receive a letter from her. She got to Beechworth all right & enjoyed the
passage by the boat very much. She complained of being tired but expected
great things from the rest she was getting & which she expected to get. Mrs
Newson was very kind to her & at Echuca she slept at Mrs Shackel?s house.
She found the journey to Beechworth by the River rather more expensive
than by the Road but preferred the former way of travelling very much. I
hope she will soon be strong & back again. I feel how much I should miss
her were she away all together & am wretched at the very idea.
August 31 Thursday 1871
Well to-day I did settle down to my Report with a will & had it all ready for
the sheriff in the afternoon. I spoke very plainly & wound up by offering to
inspect the Country Gaols if the Honorable the Chief Secretary would allow
me as my health was not good & I wanted a change of work to set me up.
The Sheriff seemed pleased with the Report altogether but was doubtful
about the latter part of it & I suppose Ellis will not like my proposing such
a thing, however I cannot help that & only hope it may be favorably
entertained. Brought my Report back to the Gaol & sat down to copy it. As
usual I found this was a hard task for me as I kept altering as I went along. It
took me about six hours to write eighteen pages of foolscap & I did not finish
till late in the evening. However on the whole I think I did very well & was
tolerably satisfied with my work. I must have written to-day for at least ten
hours & when I left off my wrist ached & so did my back. Did not go out at
all to-day but got out my pipe & some grog & ruminated over them till it
was time to go to bed. Harry full of promises to write a long letter to his
mamma. He seems however very lazily inclined just now caring for little but
sitting with a book over the fire.


September 7 Thursday 1871
Weather cloudy & changeable. Woke this morning with a nasty sore throat &
cough, expected as it was very hot last night in the theatre. I caught cold going
home as the night was chilly & 1 had no overcoat. The children looked out
most anxiously for the postman who came at last & brought a letter for me &
one each for Harry, Sissy & Dotty. After I had read the children?s letters to them
I turned to my own expecting some pleasure from it as it was a long epistle. I
was disappointed, Polly evidently was out of sorts when she wrote it & wrote
nastily saying she dreaded coming home &c. I wrote her a letter in which I told
her how much I regretted she should have sent such a letter & that I was
disappointed at her dreading to come home as the children & myself longed
for her return & were always thinking of her. Ran about this morning at my
wits end to get money. Offered Lynch my pay for next month at a pound
discount; he gave me �l2 & said he would see about getting �lO tomorrow so
that I may pay Mrs Jones? little bill. I went to the Assurance Office & paid my
premium, then came back to the Gaol. In the evening I wrote to Nathan
enclosing the Assurance Receipt & asking him to come up & see me.
Did not muster but went to the Club after five o?clock & came away at six
with Marcus Clarke. Walked with him till he purchased so huge a lobster that
he was obliged to take a cab to get it home, then went home myself to tea.
In the evening I went across to Dr Robertson?s. There I met the Rev. Mr
Lowes & his wife & spent a quiet chatty evening. Came home & got to bed
about eleven o?clock.
This was Quarterly Visiting Day at the Gaol & a crowd of people was
assembled outside the gate the whole of the day. It was pitiful to see many
respectable looking people among the number; 205 visitors were admitted.
September 15 Friday 1871
Fancied I felt better in general health this morning though my chest was still
very sore & my cough oppressive. However I had a better appetite & hoped
things were on the turn for the better. Wrote to Polly & sent one to her for
Julia. The Criminal Sittings commenced. The Calendar was a very heavy one,
there being 33 prisoners in Gaol besides several persons charged with offences
who were out on bail. In the afternoon went into town with McKinley, met
Willie Moore who was formerly Associate to the Chief Justice. He pressed us
to have a beer & so went to an hotel & hob nobbed. I called at Smyther?s the
wine merchant & got an assorted dozen of liquor from him just to enable me
to offer any one who came in a glass of wine or brandy. Came back in time
for Muster, stayed at home till after tea and then crawled into town so far as
the club. Did not however stay there very long but soon found myself at home
again. Got Julia to make me a mustard plaister which when I went to bed 1
put on my chest & kept it on for an hour or more. Really my illness is
obstinate in the extreme for I have all sorts of specifics. To-night I tried the


inhaler, a vessel which when used is filled with hot water & the steam sucked
from it through an attached tube. I sucked away & took in I suppose a
considerable quantity of vapour. Cant say however it appeared to benefit me
very much. My constitution must be a particularly obstinate one just now.
September 17 Sunday 1871
Was very unwell this morning & in fact felt as if I must give up & have done
with the world. To my other ailments Diarrhoea has been added & I am
becoming weak & powerless. Sent the elder children to church with Julia &
employed myself while they were away in writing a letter to Polly. Had for
dinner to-day lamb & green peas, the first for us of the season. Enjoyed my
dinner & the company of Sissy, Dotty & Harry who had seats at the table. In
the afternoon I went into the Gaol & saw I was not wanted & then went to St
Kilda & had a stroll on the Beach. This did me good & I returned home in
much better trim. In the evening Julia went out & I took Harry, Sissy & Dotty
to task & saw they wrote letters to their mamma. Sissy & Dotty wrote from
my dictation. Harry however managed his letter by himself. As soon as Julia
came home I went to bed. This is the end of a very unsatisfactory week & is I
fear the beginning of the end. My constitution has evidently received a shock
strong enough to send it over the hill & it now will, as may be the force of
circumstances Rapidly or steadily take the downward course until the valley of
oblivion is reached.
September 22 Friday 1871
Got up this morning fancying myself better, the wind however came on to
blow coldly & I found the atmosphere very chilly & disagreeable. Was at the
Court the greater portion of the day but attended to Muster in the afternoon.
After Muster went to the Club. In the evening Julia wanted to go out so I
stayed at home & let her go between eight & nine o?clock. Miss Phair when
giving in the keys reported that there was a great fire in the town & the light
from it could easily be seen even in the Gaol Yard. Although I was left in
charge of the children I could not stay quietly in doors but ran out to learn
if possible where was the scene of the disaster. Soon I was told it was at the
Haymarket Theatre in Bourke Street so I ran down Russell Street & at the
corner of it & Bourke Street stopped to have a good look at the blaze. It was
a fine sight & enjoyed by an enormous crowd, being just at the time when
Bourke Street is the most crowded. I shall not attempt any description to
show how dense the flames must have been. I need only say that the inside
of the theatre was entirely consumed & that it burned with the rapidity of a
box of matches set on fire, there being such a quantity of frippery &
combustible material about the place.
Ran away home but not until Dotty had missed me & got in to a bad state
from fear something had happened to me & that I was hurt or lost. Soon


quieted her & made her all right. Julia came home at about a quarter to ten.
I talked to her for a time & then went to bed. Find myself still very unwell.
Shall be very glad when Polly gets home again. Do not feel very well & fancy
I should be all the better were I again under her care & treatment.
September 23 Saturday 1871
Got up this morning at half past six & called Harry, Sissy & Dotty. I had half
promised to take them to the Eastern Market where I had to go to buy some
pigs. The morning was a fine one & the children were in excellent spirits at
the Outing. We went to look where the fire had been & saw a great heap of
ruins inside the theatre, though the exterior walls with the exception of the
windows looked much the same as usual. The fire was still burning & the
ceiling of Weather-board in Allens Bar was blazing. The constable sent for the
firemen to return & put it out as it was evident if not stopped the fire would
yet do further mischief. Went along the Market, [saw] some pigs & bought
two at 14/- each. They were better ones than those I got last time but still
they are not the kind of pigs I want, as I want some big gaunt ones ready to
eat a great deal at once & with big frames to hang meat upon.
I bought oranges, Dates & Honey for the children & some celery &
rhubarb for the general table, then we all were coming home to breakfast
when we saw poor Mrs Morphy in a great state of mind as she had lost her
purse containing about 10 or 12 shillings. I gave her a few shillings, all I had
with me, to enable her to complete her purchases & this she returned to me
in the course of the day. Attended to Gaol duties all the morning & between
twelve & one o?clock went to the club. There I met with Marcus Clarke. He
has adapted a piece of Moliere?s, Bourgeois Gentilhomme and called it Peacock?s
Feathers. It was to be produced this evening & Marcus was I fancy rather
fidgetty about it. We chummed together & agreed to take a Turkish bath. I
had never had one but Clarke was an old hand & agreed to show me the
ropes. We went to the Baths in Russell Street. 183 The first thing is to pay your
money, 184 this being done you are shown into a narrow passage on each side
of which are a number of small rooms. You enter one & strip, fastening
around your loins a piece of calico about the size of the figurative fig-leaf. An
attendant meets you when you are ready, locks the door of the room you have
left & takes away the key. You are then marshalled to the end of the passage
& admitted through a door opened for the purpose into a room which is
most uncomfortably hot & even oven like. Here you find a number of
individuals clad as simply as yourself standing or sitting about the room & in
different degrees of perspiration. There is a little fountain in the middle of
the room around which are placed glasses for water which is freely imbibed
183 The Turkish and Sulphur Baths at 127 Russell Street evidently opened in 1871. See Sands
& McDougall Melbourne and Suburban Directory, 1870, 1871.
184 Recorded as 2/- in the accounts at the back of the diary for 1871.


as an inducement to cause a copious sweat. You place your towel on a
wooden bench & sit down. Even with the towel next your skin it is
uncomfortably warm & it would be almost beyond human endurance to sit
on the Bench itself unless it was covered with something. Clarke & I stayed
in this room till we were supposed to have sweated sufficiently then we went
into an inner & still hotter room where we stayed till the attendants, naked
sprites, invited us into an inner room where we were made to lie down on
Benches fixed for the purpose & where we were rubbed &
September 24 Sunday 1871 [i.e. Saturday contd]
pummelled, soaped & scraped at the discretion of those who for the time
being had the charge of us. Then we were passed under a shower bath &
deluged at first with luke warm & afterwards with quite cold water. Then we
were partially dried, given a small sheet to wrap around our shoulders & a
towel to gird around our loins & passed into a comfortable room where there
were couches & sofas & where we reposed until we were dried & felt inclined
to dress. I hardly know what to say about the success of the Bath. I certainly
did not feel the exhiliration after it that 1 have heard is felt & raved about,
but then I was not well & could not rightly judge how much jollier I should
have been had I taken the Bath when in good health. One thing is certain,
there is a pleasant feeling of being intensely clean & a lightness in
consequence that is agreeable. I shall certainly have one or two more Turkish
Baths before I shall think of condemning or finding fault with them. While
with Clarke to-day I got talking of Cousens an Engineer whom 1 knew at
Beechworth & who is down here very hard up. I said I would let him have a
pound. Clarke sent him to me after I got home & Cousens asked for �2 to
help pay his landlord. I gave it him telling him at the same time I could ill
spare the money. Cousens has some grand ideas of a new motive Power &C has
written a Paper on the subject which he has intrusted to Ellery. He is very
sanguine of being on the road to fortune. I trust his ideas may prove practical
& valuable. A man stuck up in the street to-day & borrowed five shillings to
take him to Kyneton. I gave it him & he is to send it back to me out of the
first wages he earns. Received a letter from Polly this morning & sent her a
cheque for �7 to bring her home again. She seems getting fidgetty & will I
hope be glad when the time comes for her to return home. In the evening I
went to the theatre. Peacock?s Feathers went very well & was amusing enough
though it was made up of very slender materials. It had a decided success &
the house was crowded. Clarke was called but did not show. John Dunne
who played the principal part in the comedy came before the Curtain &
thanked the audience on behalf of the Adaptor. He said the Author had been
dead about 150 years so that was very good reason why he could not
personally return thanks for the favor with which the Piece had been
received. I stayed for the Burlesque & then got home before eleven o?clock.


October 7 Saturday 1871
Felt very much better this morning & believe I am getting the better of my
cough & shall cheat the Devil this time after all. Enjoyed my breakfast & went
into the office in tolerably good time & transacted the ordinary morning?s
business. Began to look over my account Books & they made me very far from
happy. I had to pay Mrs Jones �lO so I wrote a cheque for her & took it to
Walford telling him I hoped there was money enough left in the bank to meet
it. Came back to the gaol & had a chat with Polly about money matters,
showed her as well as I could how we stood with the world & what I had done
with the money borrowed from Nathan, agreed with Polly not to buy any
more wine or spirits but to be content with a little Colonial beer for dinner &
for supper. I do not know whether either of us will stand strictly to this but
believe we shall both be more careful than we have been for the future.
After dinner Polly & I agreed to go out together. First of all however she
got weighed on the Scales in the Yard & to her disgust found that instead of
weighing 9 stone 9 as she said she did at Beechworth she only weighed 9
stone 3 or about the same as she was said to have done when she first got to
Beechworth. There must have been some difference in the weights as Polly
certainly has got heavier since she has been away. Taylor then weighed me &
reported me to be 9.7 which is a lb heavier than I was two days ago. If this is
correct there is no doubt the iron is doing me good & that I am beginning
to pick up again. Polly & I went by the train to Elsternwick & called upon
Dotty. We found Hall & Dotty busy in the Garden. They were surprised to
see Polly as they had not heard of her return home. We stayed at Hall?s till
after tea & left for Melbourne by the 7.20 train. At the Elsternwick Station
we saw Cowderoy & he went in the same carriage with us as far as Richmond.
When we got to town we took a walk through Bourke Street & looked in at
the Eastern Market. The vegetables in the Market were very fine & plentiful.
Oranges & lemmons were in abundance & very cheap. There was besides the
ordinary ?Cheap Jack? a china-man in that line of business. John was busy &
had around him rather more people than his European contemporary.
Bought The Australasian & returned home. The walk had done Polly good &
she pitched with much satisfaction into a pig?s trotter for her supper.
Soon went to bed, everyone being up stairs by ten o?clock.
Began thinking to-day it was very foolish that Harriette & I should keep
away so much from one another. I do not know how it is, this however I feel,
that I am somewhat to blame for I have taken too much notice of things she
has said & done. She would have patronized me when I came down only
instead of inwardly laughing at her as I should have done I foolishly resented
it & would not even go to nice people she knew because she would have had
the chance of boasting of her introduction. Something must be done to make
us more brotherly & sisterly.


October 21 Saturday 1871
Was very unwell this morning feeling extremely bilious, consequently was cross
& unmanageable, spoke unkindly to Polly, had breakfast & went into the Gaol
in a temper. The day was very fine. Polly wanted me to go to Elsternwick to
spend the afternoon at the Cowderoys. I could not however very well manage
to do so without feeling uncomfortable as we had new servants. The worry of
prison servants in our house is a constant blister to my temper & prevents me
ever feeling comfortable away from home as I cannot throw off the
remembrance of being entirely at their mercy so far as their staying is
concerned, for if they chose to run away they have abundant chances of doing
so which as the house is situated cannot be avoided. Mary, a woman who was
sentenced to be hanged & afterwards reprieved & her sentence commuted to
ten years imprisonment, has been one of our servants for some time past &
behaved remarkably well. Her former Mistress, Mrs George Watson, fitted her
well out with clothes & Mr George Watson promised to meet her on her
discharge this morning & take her to a Registry office & procure her a situation
up country. I gave her a sovereign Government money 185 so she has every
chance if she means well. She was guilty of infanticide but had a high character
before she committed the crime. Mustered in the afternoon. In the evening
went to The Yorick. Our rooms are taken away while alterations are being made
& another room given us which is awkward to get at as the entrance to it is
through the Bar of the Hotel & then up-stairs.
October 22 Sunday 1871
Got up this morning in the tantrums & did not get down stairs till nine
o?clock, then I found the women had refused their hominy for breakfast &
there was trouble in the Gaol in consequence. Growled because I had not
been told when Mrs Nixon the officer in charge brought some of the hominy
for me to look at & then went into the Gaol, having first fortified myself with
the knowledge that the men had eaten their breakfast without murmuring. I
went into the women?s Yard & abused them soundly, telling them that they
had only refused the hominy because it was Sunday morning & to give
trouble & that if they did?ent like Gaol fare they should stop outside. There
was some grumbling & then I went to the kitchen. Here I found I had been
hasty for the men?s hominy had been served much later than the women?s &
that in reality the women?s hominy though eatable had not been properly
cooked & there were some grounds for complaining of it. The boilers in the
kitchen are out of order & a new set is being erected. This has upset the
arrangements & a great waste of steam from a defective pipe prevented the
hominy being cooked in time for the breakfast at the usual hour & the cook
185 Note this was not out of Castieau's pocket, in contrast to many other instances in the
diaries when he loans or gives money to friends or associates.


foolishly dished it instead of serving it later. I made the amend}* 6 as far as I
could by seeing about the dinner & directing that the women should be
allowed extra hominy in the afternoon.
October 25 Wednesday 1871
Jane, a prisoner woman whom Polly has employed as a Nurse for a number
of times came to-day to say she had tried very hard indeed since she was last
discharged to get something to do but had failed. She was hungry & eat
ravenously the food that was given to her. Polly told her she would see if there
was any place of Refuge for her to take shelter in & promised to see the Rev.
George Mackie to-day about her. It is idle talking of Prison reform unless
there is some place provided for prisoners on their discharge from Gaol where
they can have an opportunity of showing by their conduct their desire to lead
honest lives.
October 26 Thursday 1871
This morning Polly went to see Dr Singleton to find out whether he could
procure Jane a place of Refuge. The Doctor sent her to the temporary home
for fallen women at Collingwood & Polly was very much pleased with her
visit to this place & with the Matron or conductress. There were a number
of women industriously employed remaining at the Home quite of their
own accord. No uniform, no bolts or bars & nothing but self restriction.
Arrangements were made for Jane?s going there this evening, so when she
came Polly took her & left her grateful for the shelter & hopeful of the
future. Polly took some lettuces out of the garden for the women for which
the Matron said they would be thankful.
November 5 Sunday 1871
Before I went to bed last night I took a couple of Cockle?s pills & so had an
excuse for not going to church this morning. Polly went & took some of the
youngsters. In the garden I pulled or rather cut a large number of fine lettuces
& sent them in to the women. When Polly came home & we had had dinner,
she asked me to take her out & I consented to go where she liked. Just then
Walter began to play up with Julia & the whole house was in confusion for
some hour or more, the young vagabond exercising a powerful pair of lungs
in the most determined manner. Julia had given him a slap in the face &
knocked his head against the wall & nothing would satisfy him apparently as
he fancied he had a grievance. I gave him half a dozen heavy cuts with my
cane & that seemed to quiet him. A little after three Polly came down ready
for an Outing. She decided to go to see Mr & Mrs Littlewood so we took a
car for St Kilda & when we got there had a little blow on the Beach & then
went off to the Littlewoods. We found Mr & Mrs Littlewood at home & had
186 Fr. 'reparation'.


a chat with them for an hour or more then resisting an hospitable invitation
from them to stay to tea we came away for home. In the cab we took was
Barclay & a friend. Polly had a long chat with Barclay about Beechworth &
the Beechworth people. Found that Walter was inclined to be a good boy, he
had been sent to bed so I let him get up for a while. I think his punishment
will probably be of benefit to him. There certainly is a necessity for curbing
the tempers of our youngsters, some of them want breaking in badly. Stayed
at home in the evening & went to bed about ten o?clock. Julia?s beau came to
visit her but I do not think he took her out.
Had a piece of ham at dinner to-day of our own curing, it was very good.
November 13 Monday 1871
Felt very worried when I got up this morning for during the whole of the night
I was uneasily lying half asleep & half awake thinking & sweating over my
liabilities without seeing any prospect of successfully dealing with them. Went to
the Bank & found there was only a trifle to my Credit. When I got back I went
to the Sheriff?s Office & talked money with Walford. He was very anxious to help
me & at my suggestion 1 accepted a Bill for �5O which he sent to his Account at
the Bank for Discount. If the Bill is Approved I shall get a cheque for the Amount
from Walford. Stayed about the Gaol the whole afternoon but did not Muster.
Went into town & called at Goyders where I paid a Book-maker named
Bradbury �3 & left with him �2.10 to pay another named John Thompson. Met
at Goyders Mr Allingham, Mr Hayes & Mr Whiteman, we all had a glass of
sherry & a chat when we were joined by Mr Smyth who is Crown Prosecutor &
was for a short time a Judge. Did not go out in the evening. Polly far from well
& still suffering from neuralgia. Went to the Club for a few minutes before tea
time to look for Cane to whom I am indebted �2. He did not happen to be at
the Club though Marcus Clarke had seen him there but a short time before.
Have had a good deal of bother in the Gaol with some female lunatics.
Shall I am glad to say get rid of two of the worst of them to-morrow.
November 14 Tuesday 1871
Fussing & worrying about money matters all the day. Had long conferences
with Polly who was not very well & dull & miserable in consequence of the
pecuniary difficulties we have to encounter. We counted up & found we owe
altogether close upon �350 & with little or no means of paying any part of
it just at present. Polly went off City-ward quite prepared to do something
desperate & when I came home she met me with a tearful face & let me
know she had been to consult with Wyburn & that he had given her no
encouragement at all. He advised borrowing money on Life Assurance & got
the tables of the Alliance Assurance Compy. to show how it could be done.
He however evidently did?ent understand the figures & made out twelve
quarterly payments to mean twelve monthly ones. I explained this to Polly &
went into town & got the papers myself to show what I stated was correct.


Polly cheered up a good deal at this & I hoped she would get better, she
was however taken very bad towards the evening & had to go to bed.
Dr Robertson came over to see her in the evening & she came down stairs to
him. He wrote a prescription & I sent & got the medicine. The doctor would
not stop long but after a little kind chat went away. I sat up & smoked for a
time then went off to bed. By the way I tried to get a Bill discounted through
Walford?s Bank. They smelt however Accommodation & would not have
anything to do with it.
November 15 Wednesday 1871
Polly rather better this morning & full of good intentions. The Court
commenced this morning & I was at the Court House the greater portion of
the day. When I came home to lunch I found Polly again despondent. She
had been to see Bell with whom she was formerly very friendly. He
sympathised to the extent of saying he was sorry he could not become one of
the Sureties as the Rules of his Partnership prohibited it.
Polly & I had another chat & I resolved to write a letter to Moton Moss
the well known money lender & see what terms I could make with him. I
knew Dr & Mrs Robertson were sincere people & that they would help Polly
if they could so I got her to take the letter over to the doctor & ask him to
give it to Moton Moss as a sort of introduction as the doctor is acquainted
with Moss & I do not know him. When I saw Polly she told me the doctor
would not hear of my going to Moss but offered to be one of the Sureties &
to give me his cheque for mine to make up the money which is most
pressingly needed. The doctor was most kind & my heart bounded into my
throat when I heard of his kindness! Oh the humiliation of debt! Oh the
worry the trouble & the anxiety one little fit of extravagance occasions. What
a sacrifice of independence does the man make who gets into debt, what
weakness he displays in living just for the present moment & by his
thoughtlessness storing up future troubles for himself & family. Wrote to
Lynch & asked him to renew a Bill I had given him. Went to the Club in the
evening, saw Jardine Smith. He gave me 5/- I won from him at the Races.
November 16 Thursday 1871
Attended at the Court this morning.
Saw William Lynch who very kindly brought me Cash to take up his Bill
due on Saturday. I gave him another Acceptance for �39.15.5 which is the
amount I owe him altogether. Polly went to St Kilda to-day & came back
delighted with the kindness she had received from Mr & Mrs Littlewood.
Littlewood consented without any hesitation to be a surety to the Insurance
Company so that now I have two good names & only require one more to be
able to make my proposal for a loan. If my Life is considered good I am
confident I shall have no trouble as I have such good security to offer. Went
to the Club between five & six o?clock this evening but came home to tea.


Polly did not come home till later in the evening. Began to night to read again
The Vicar of Wakefield & was delighted with its quaint easy style, read two or
three chapters to Harry who was very attentive & in a sad state when I had to
send him away to his lessons. Harry is very fond of reading & has picked up
a good deal of information on one subject or another by the practice he has
got of conning well every Newspaper that comes in his way. Met Joe in town
to-day & was glad to hear from him Bill was getting on all right.
November 17 Friday 1871
Got up this morning much lighter hearted. Polly still eager for further
execution & started off to see Kerferd. She came back at dinner time having
been well received. Kerferd promised to see Mr O?Grady the Secretary to the
Alliance Compy. & also Commissioner of Public Works & Polly was to call
on him again in the afternoon. When she went back Kerferd told her that he
had a long talk with O?Grady about me & that my paper was gone before the
Board to expedite it though it would be necessary I should get a third Surety.
Kerferd said he would not be Surety as if he should be in power to do me
good some time from his parliamentary position, it would interfere with his
doing so if he was responsible on my account. Polly & Kerferd talked the
matter over & eventually Joe White was fixed upon as the right man to ask.
November 19 Sunday 1871
Got up this morning at the usual time & went to Church with Polly Harry,
Sissy & Dotty. In the afternoon mustered & after that took Sissy, Walter &
Godfrey to meet their mamma who had gone with Harry & Dotty to see
Aunty Emma. Had to go all the way & found Polly & her charge chatting
with Joe & Emma & the family. William Lotherington was there &
according to his own account liked his life on board of the Dandenong.' m I
gave Agnes my bouquet & holder. Got home by tea time & in the evening
went into town with the intention of calling at the Club. There was however
no sign of light about the place & as I did?ent care to knock at the Public
house door I came away without going in. Walked through Spring Street
towards home & could not help remarking how little the Sabbath seemed to
be observed save as a holiday in some of the houses. Outside one residence a
crowd was collected listening to some operatic singing that was going on
within. I stopped a moment & heard some musical talent displayed of no
ordinary kind & at the next minute heard through the open window of the
adjoining house a dispute going on about the ace of trumps. Afterwards
passing down Latrobe Street and just opposite the Police Barracks I heard in
a house the Piano going & a number of folk enjoying a lively polka. How
much longer will it be before Sunday will be recognised only as a holiday?
187 A steamer ?which shortly after went out of business?plying the Melbourne-Warnambool
route. See Diary, 8 December 1871.


November 20 Monday 1871
A rather fine day though a little inclined to hot wind. Went to the Court at
ten o?clock this morning & afterwards called upon Dr Motherwell to be
examined by him on behalf of the Assurance Compy. from whom I propose
to borrow the money that will get me out of debt. The doctor was very kind
& chatted most amiably while he asked the preliminary questions before I
laid bare my massive chest. As soon as he saw it, he exclaimed ?Hullo you
have been doctoring here?. At first I did not understand but soon
remembered a mustard plaister I had had at one time while under the
influence of a bad cough & cold. The doctor sounded me most gently &
whether or no my body discoursed most excellent music he seemed satisfied
& began to talk upon topics foreign to the subject business of my visit, Penal
discipline & other kindred subjects. ?There?s one thing more for you now to
do,? said the doctor & led me to a little instrument like the model of a
gasometer ?Now let me see how much air your lungs will hold.? I siezed a tube
that was hanging from the instrument & began to blow down it as hard as
ever I could till stopped by the doctor who assured me I was altogether wrong
& instead of doing what he required was disarranging the machine. I tried to
learn, made a great fuss, inflated my lungs & with a lamentable littleness only
puffed 170. That wont do my lad said the doctor. I puffed away again & with
much the same result. Then I puffed again & reached 210 & I firmly believe
with half an hour?s practice I could puff 310 just as or a great deal more easily.
The doctor however said the 210 would do and I went away feeling satisfied
I had passed the ordeal necessary to insure my Life being accepted. The Case
against Cuthbert in the Mining Court was heard to-day before Judge
Molesworth. Judgment was reserved.
Went to the Club this afternoon. I did not muster as I had been through
the Gaol with the V. Justice. Stayed at home in the evening & played Bezique
with Polly. Harry gave lots of trouble over his sums & at length I was obliged
to give him just a little bit of a thrashing which did him good.
November 30 Thursday 1871
St Andrews Day kept as a holiday by the Banks. By Post this morning Harry
got an invitation to attend the Scotch College School Sports. Godfrey
Lotherington sent two tickets, one for Harry & one for me. Mamma however
arranged that Harry & Walter should make use of them & they did so
accordingly. There was a holiday at the Sheriff?s Office. After dinner to-day, I
was lazily lying on the Sofa when Marcus Clarke put in an appearance; he had
brought Mrs Clarke to see Polly. Did not Muster this afternoon but went to
the Club after four o?clock instead. Walked part of the way home with Jardine
Smith & Duerdin. The dinner the Club is to give to Anthony Trollope will
come off on the sixteenth of December. My name is down for it or I should
not be inclined to pay the guinea. Stayed at home this evening & after doing


a little reading & visiting the pigs played Bezique with Polly till it was time to
go to bed. This morning I went into town & called upon Walsh. He promised
he would do what he could to help me obtain promotion. I called upon him
in the shop & he bewildered me with the civility of the shopkeeper. It is very
hard to ask a man a favor when he is continually sir-ring you & treating you
as if you were in a superior position. Behind the Counter is no place for a
member of Parliament. This is the last day the Sheriffs will have full charge of
the Gaols, to-morrow Mr Duncan commences to reign in their stead.
December 4 Monday 1871
Got up at half past five this morning & went into the Gaol where I saw the
men on Parade, then went into the Old Wing & saw the irons taken off
Geary. This man seemed in a state of religious exaltation & to have no fear
of his approaching death. He said how lucky he was to be about to die as he
was with all the comforts of religion about him. Now, said he, I shall have
Mass & then the Holy Sacrament at the very last, how different from many
a poor fellow in the Bush, ?Glory be to God?. Not, however, continued he,
hut what I had taken care to be in reach of a Minister where I was staying.
From Geary?s manner since he has been under my notice I am of opinion that
he has for a long time been brooding over his crime & has paid great
attention to his religious duties in the hope of obtaining mercy from Heaven
if not from man. At ten o?clock the usual crowd had assembled in the Gaol
& the usual formalities were gone through, after which Geary was hanged.
He was praying devoutly to the last moment & until he was placed on the
dock was very strong & self supported. The usual tremor came over him at
the very last; he died without a struggle. Dr Barber was present & took the
part as usual of directing executioner.
Polly took baby down to Elsternwick to be out of the way of the Gaol while
the execution was going on. The weather the whole day was fearfully hot &
dusty. I had to go down to the Penal Office & was tolerably well roasted.
Mustered in the afternoon. After Muster went into town & called at the
Club, then came home to tea. Went out again in the evening. The Club room
was more like the hot room at a Turkish Bath than an ordinary apartment. I
got Duerdin to go out for a walk & we strolled up & down Bourke & Collins
Streets for more than an hour. When I went home Polly was at Mrs
Robertson?s & did not come home till past eleven o?clock. She had being
having oysters & came home in jovial spirits the doctor accompanying her. I
wrote a letter to my father to-day & said some very plain things in it.
However as I was going to the Post Office I made up my mind that it would
not do any good & might cause the old man uneasiness so I did not post it.
Got some stamps & sent The Australasians for the month. Polly very unwell
& was to-day obliged to come from Elsternwick earlier than she intended in
consequence. Hall was at home to-day suffering from a galled foot.


December 8 Friday 1871
This morning I was unable to sleep after four o?clock so at about half past four I
got up & dressed then went through the Gaol, after which I took a stroll through
the meat market & then through the Eastern Market. In the latter I saw Joe,
Emma & Agnes. They had bought six lbs of strawberries & were contemplating
other similar extravagances. I was sorry to hear from Joe that the Steamer on
board which William has got employment is not likely to be kept on as the trade
to Warrnambool has not paid her owners. I hope Bill will not be long out of a
billet but am afraid this will interfere somewhat with the merry christmas the
Lotheringtons had cause to anticipate. Before I came home to breakfast I bought
a Snapper as it looked a nice fish. I heard however afterwards Snapper was not
very good & I must say we found it very dry & without much flavour. In
The Argus of this morning there was a leading article commenting on Duncans
appointment to the charge of the Gaols 188 & showing pretty clearly it was
impossible he could do justice to all the Establishments placed under his control.
I spoke of this leader in the Sheriff?s office & Ellis looked very knowing & said
he was aware it was coming some days ago. I made Jardine Smith laugh at this
& he declared no one knew he had written [it] till the day before & only then
when he sent his copy into the office & had written without any prompting
from the office & the office even did?ent know he was going to write.
December 9 Saturday 1871
Got up this morning feeling tolerably jolly & comfortable. Went to Church
with Polly, Sissy, Dotty & Harry. The weather was fine but rather warm.
After dinner we had a feast of strawberries & cherries & then Polly took the
little girls to see Mrs Smith. Mustered & then lazily read The Cloister and the
Hearth by Read until Polly came home to tea. In the evening I went into
town for a stroll & called at the Club where I met Jardine Smith, Kane,
Purvis & Telo. Jardine Smith & I left the Club together & as he was passing
near our house I induced him to come in & have a smoke & some brandy &
water. We got on very jollily as Polly likes Mr Smith & were talking away very
freely when our visitor?s chair (a ladies one) collapsed & brought him very
funnily to the ground. Of course we all laughed & Smith himself took his
downfall very good temperedly. Got talking Shop & in a moment of
confidence I told my position as regards money & showed with all my
supposed advantages how hard it was to get along at all & make both ends
meet. Smith left at about eleven. I smoked another pipe or two & then went
to bed feeling none the better for Smith?s strong tobacco. I had borrowed or
rather took some from his pouch as my own was empty. The new boilers in
the Gaol Cook-house were used to-day for the first time. Some of the women
complained that the hominy tasted nasty.
188 Duncan became Inspector-General of Penal Establishments.


December 10 Sunday 1871
December 11 Monday 1871 189
Somehow or other I have got wrong a day with my diary & am now writing
this on Tuesday afternoon & can only record in these two pages for Monday.
I was busy all day in the office worrying over a lot of Returns that have to be
done for Mr Duncan?s office. Mrs Gee this morning had ordered a virago of
a woman into her cell when the woman turned upon her & made a grab at
her brooch which she tore off her neck & ground to pieces in her mouth. I
sent for Mr Sturt the Visiting Justice & he ordered her two months
additional sentence. Mr Alexr. Rodgers who was well known to us at
Beechworth called this afternoon & stayed for a while chatting about
Beechworth & Beechworth people. Mr Barrett the Clerk of Works called by
Appointment to meet Mr Duncan & came in to our house until the big man
arrived. Duncan came in due course & we went to look at a proposed
alteration in the Labor Yard. Mr Duncan promised to come & spend the
afternoon on Wednesday & make a thorough inspection of the Gaol. I can
get along with Duncan very well but feel tolerably certain there will soon be
a row between myself & Snelling as I can see by his Memos he means making
mischief. Did not muster but went into Melbourne & called at the
Club where I saw Jardine Smith, Duerdin & some others with whom I am
tolerably well acquainted. Came home to tea & spent the evening reading
The Cloister and [the] Hearth. Polly left off practising the piano at a little
before nine & then we played a couple of games of Bezique after which like
good children we toddled off to bed. 1 hardly know how to conclude these
pages & fear I must write rubbish to enable me to do so. Heard Dotty read
to-night & was quite pleased at finding she was very much improved & able
to read easy words without any trouble. Harry is a great fellow for reading
but something like his father has a fancy for skimming, instead of reading
books & so can generally be found with four or five different books scattered
about him. The dinner the Yorick Club talk of giving to Trollope does not
seem to create much enthusiasm among the members of the club & judging
from the small number there are who have promised to attend I fear it will
be next akin to a failure, unless the arrival of the novelist will ?stir men?s
blood? & make them forget the shillings in the satisfaction of entertaining a
man who has created for himself a firm standing in the literary world
although he has done too much writing not to have written a good deal that
his friends might well wish unwritten.
December 16 Saturday 1871
Got up this morning at half past five & took Sissy & Dotty to the market
where we bought strawberries, Gooseberries & flowers. Got home at a little
189 As the dates indicate, Castieau wrote up the entry for these two days together


after seven o?clock. Was busy in the Gaol till after eleven o?clock, then I went
into the Court & asked the Sheriff to attend an Enquiry at the Gaol with
regard to a statement made by a prisoner concerning the conduct of Detective
Christie. Went into town & called for Mr Sturt. Got him & brought him up
in a cab with me. The Enquiry was gone into & the Detective was accused of
what is called putting up? robberies & conniving at others, in fact he was made
out to be an infernal villain & a thorough faced scoundrel. The prisoner
Williams who made the statement said Christie had given him some skeleton
keys which he must have taken out of the Detective Office. Williams said these
keys were now lying at the top of his house & could be identified by some of
the detectives if they were got. After the Enquiry was over I took a cab & went
with Turnkey Buck to the place described & sure enough there was a bunch of
skeleton keys. The statement of Williams is a most determined one & given
with a fair show of frankness, still it is only a statement & it would be very
unfair to judge Christie upon it without some substantial corroboration.
December 25 Monday 1871
Christmas day was a very busy one with us. Polly & nurse were hard at work
at a dozen different things from very early morning. The decorating the
rooms with green stuff took some time. We had as many flowers as we could
get & made up with branc[h]es of fig, vine & Mulberry. Joe & Emma with
their two boys came at a little after one o?clock & shortly after Edwin Smith
put in an appearance. We had extemporised a leaf to our table & managed to
sit down very comfortably. The geese were rather hard to carve but the
pudding was a tremendous success increased by the four penny pieces which
were scattered in it. Sissy & Dotty each got one & so did Uncle Joe. We had
a dozen bon-bons to amuse the youngsters with in the afternoon; the caps
they got in them caused a good deal of fun. After a visit to the pigs & poultry
we all went into the playground where we played all sort of little games &
wound up with a game of cricket. Polly about this time had retired & was
suffering badly from an attack of indigestion. She got all right however again
in the evening. After tea Flory Morphy, Maggie & Dotty Robertson came
over & we got up a dance, Lucy Morphy & Mrs Parkins joining in for some
time. Polly & I went to bed at last both pretty fairly tired out with our
exertions as must have been Julia for she worked & played like a regular little
brick for the whole of the day. Aunty Emma gave Sissy & Dotty each a doll
& one was given to baby by Uncle Joe.
December 28 Thursday 1871
Was very busy all the morning in the Gaol & none the better able to do the
work for having as I did a nasty attack of dispepsia. Mr Nicholson came to
the Gaol with Detective Walker to make further enquiry into a statement
made by a prisoner against Detective Christie. I went with the prisoner & the

officers of Police to a Pawn shop where we saw a pair of ear-rings which
Christie, the prisoner said, had given to his (the prisoner's) wife. The
Detective took possession of the ear-rings. Fred Brown & Mr Shadforth came
to see us but I was not able to go into the house & so did not see them.
Mustered in the afternoon, at muster a woman named Mclnnery was very
noisy & was complained about for having broken her night-stool. After I had
passed her cell, she began to smash & so when Muster was finished I went to
her cell & threatened her with a strait waistcoat. Upon this she got violent &
first of all tried to claw me & then flung a pannican at my head. The
pannican struck the wall & bounded back to the far end of the cell. I went
& picked it up & turned to leave where off the virago got her boot & let fly.
The female officers however got the door shut & me out before the missile
reached its destination & it came with the bang that might be expected from
a Gaol boot against an iron clad door. The female officers mourned over me
like the females did over the Faithful Shepherd in Pickwick & I could'ent
help feeling very much amused though not edified over the whole affair. In
the evening went into Melbourne & called at the Club where I saw Duerdin
& walked for a time with him in Bourke Street.


Chapter 5: 1872
'Jacks as good as his master
It was in the year 1872 that Castieau devoted himself to the diary as never
before or after. The entries for that year amount in total to about 150 000
words and cover personal and familial concerns in a wider context than any
other year. They also signal a diarist at ease with the form in a way that goes
beyond the observation of events and opinion to reflect in his own guarded
way on the world passing before him.
Living on the edge of the city the Castieaus were superbly placed to catch
the rhythms of urban life. Whatever anxieties might have been felt by
Melbourne?s middle classes about the ?pathology of the night?, 190 it is striking
how free city-dwellers like the Castieaus felt in wandering the city at night.
It is true that they avoided the back-lanes, but the principal protection
followed from their sociability?going to the theatre or shopping in the
night-time meant almost always going as part of a crowd of family or friends.
The city at night offered endless spectacle that the Castieaus enjoyed as much
as any. When a city fire broke out late one Sunday night in August, ?we were
both very sleepy, but Polly must go to a fire if there is any chance of getting
to it & so we got up? and off they went about midnight to see the ?great blaze?
a few blocks away.
There were other free entertainments of the city, some closer to the
circumstances of Castieaus employment. A sensational divorce case early in
the year provoked in Castieau a conventional distaste for the vulgar and
vicarious enthusiasms of the crowd who attended the court ?when there is any
sexual matter gone into?. There was no shortage of court business to attract
the interest of the crowd during this year that began with the trials of a ship?s
captain over the wreck of his ship at the entrance to the bay, and ended with
the sensational trial of two other mariners for the murder of South Sea
Islanders during a blackbirding venture at Bougainville.
Alternating rises and falls in expectations about his own future continued
to weigh on Castieau during 1872. A renewed application for promotion was
met by a decisive re-buff from the premier and Charles Gavan Duffy, Chief
Secretary, who wanted to see the gaols become more ?self supporting?, a
requirement which Castieau considered, with some justification, as
excessively burdensome when the Melbourne Gaol served also as a remand
prison. The sense of thwarted ambition was pervasive in a year when Castieau
also faced some rebellion within the warders? ranks, where an incipient trade
unionism was making its presence felt. The charges made against him by the
190 See Andrew Brown-May, Melbourne Street Life: The Itinerary of Our Days (Kew, Vic.: Australian
Scholarly Publishing, 1998), p. 117.


leading agitator of the warders drove the prison governor to exasperation:
?Jack?s as good as his master and a little better under the present democratic
state of affairs?.
A change of government later in the year brought Castieau back into the
range of influence. His sister was a governess to the family of the new
attorney-general and intimations came by letter from her of a favourable view
of Castieau becoming the inspector-general. But not even Polly?s eager
pressing of his case before the new premier was enough to bring the desired
promotion. So the year ended with the diarist railing against the ?meannesses
and trickeries of the Civil Service?. Not even the comfort of a bed-time toddy
was left to Castieau and Polly, so burdened by debt that they had decided to
suspend purchase of any more drink until they could afford it ?to keep, as
he put it, a ?Temperance Hotel?. 191
January 1 Monday 1872
A few minutes before the commencement of the new year Polly & I went
over to Mrs Morphy?s & as the clock struck twelve did a little kissing all
round. Had a glass of wine & then went home thinking there would be no
keeping up the New Year as in olden times; but we were mistaken for after
divers pricking up of ears at fancied distant music & just as I was getting
into bed, a martial band came nearer & nearer till at length it stopped at
Dr Robertson?s door. There was no going to bed then so after hastily
dressing again I ran across with Polly & with Harry who had been got up
by his mother. The doctor & De Verdon were busily engaged opening
bottles to refresh the musicians & I helped them most liberally dispensing
the doctor?s drink. The band was that of the Carlton Volunteers who came
to do honor to Dr Robertson their medical officer. After two or three tunes
& a like number of drinks, ?Auld Lang Syne? was played & then the band
marched off taking a pretty considerable crowd that had collected away
with it. Then our turn came & we sat down to eat, & drank till the men
folk were rather more jolly than well behaved. It was three o?clock before
we got home. Up at usual time, the day was lovely & the holiday was
largely taking [i.e. taken] advantage of, all Melbourne nearly turning out.
Harry Hall & our Harry went to the Hippodrome in the afternoon & Polly
took the youngsters up the River in a boat & landed them at the Botanical
Gardens. In the evening Polly took the whole of the children to the Wax
Works. I stayed at home, smoked & drank toddy. Heard this afternoon at
the Club, that the Sussex one of Wigram?s crack ships was lost coming into
the Heads. Five of her sailors were drowned. When I came home I heard
Polly had gone to Dr Robertson?s. Was going to bring her home when I met
Jemmy Robertson coming for me. Had a nice friendly supper.
191 Diary, 28 January 1872.


January 2 Tuesday 1872
Woke up this morning with an uncomfortable feeling that I should receive
unpleasant correspondence from the office. Mr Duncan called in the afternoon
& spoke to me about a Return I had said could not be done without extra
clerical assistance. He pooh poohed the idea & of course got his way but I had
the satisfaction of speaking pretty freely to him on various matters.
Had a goose for dinner. While we were picking the bones Gale came in &
astounded us with the information that he was ordered to Beechworth to
take charge of the Gaol. Gale did?ent like the idea but we spoke highly of the
place & comforted him as much as it was in our power to do. Went into town
with Gale in the afternoon & saw him start for Pentridge, then went to the
Club & read the papers. In the evening Polly went to the Circus with the
youngsters & I stayed at home in charge of the baby who fortunately for me
was good enough to keep asleep the whole time they were away. When Polly
came home I gladly went to bed.
There is a girl named Mclnnery, alias Considine in the Gaol who is a great
nuisance to the Gaol, myself & the officers. She has a foul tongue & when
the fit is on spares no one the use she can make of it against them. She is
terribly destructive & has torn to shreds several sets of bedding & broken to
pieces several night stools. I do not know what to do, reasoning has no effect
nor punishment either. ?Quite sane? the doctor declares, so repugnant to my
feelings as it is I have been obliged to leave her without bedding & without
tub. There she is like a wild beast, without even the cleanliness of one, she
dirts one cell & then she is removed to another. It is hard to tell what she
wants, except it is to go to the Yarra Bend. 192
January 10 Wednesday 1872
Another very hot day & one I found particularly wearisome. I was up at half past
five & went into the Gaol where I attended to many things particularly about
providing a supply of water for any emergency. All through the day a dull
Enquiry into the charges brought against the Detectives was carried on by
Messrs Wright & Sturt. 193 There were very strong assertions made by the
prisoners but they were uncorroborated & consequently were not received as
being of much value. My own opinion however still is that there has been a great
deal done by the Detectives which they had no right to do & which put them
very nearly on a par with the Criminal Class from whom they looked for the
information which was to get them the designation of?active & zealous officers?.
192 One of Melbourne?s lunatic asylums.
193 See Diary 16 &23 December 1871. A prisoner had alleged that Detective Christie had
been involved in planting evidence and framing suspected criminals. The detectives were
cleared {The Argus, 11 Jan 1872, p. 5). Castieau?s son later edited Christie?s reminiscences,
Reminiscences of Detective Inspector Christie Related by J.B. Castieau , (Melbourne:
George Robertson and Co., n.d.), see also John Lahey, Damn You, John Christie!: The
Public Life of Australia's Sherlock Holmes (Melbourne: State Library of Victoria, 1993).


Mustered in the afternoon & in the evening went to the Club where I met
Duerdin, we had a little walk together & on his pressing me I went with him
into Scotts & had some Ballan water & ice. To Duerdin?s surprise on his
tendering a shilling for payment the waitress told him each drink was a
shilling. As it happened Duerdin had no more silver so I had to pay for my
own drink. Got home at a little before ten o?clock. The wind changed at
about five o?clock but the change was not very decided & the house
continued to be terribly hot. Was obliged to go to bed without a bath & felt
?used up?.
January 14 Sunday 1872
This was a terribly hot day. In the morning Polly did not seem to care about
going to church so I took five of the youngsters, leaving the two little ones at
home with Polly. In the afternoon I felt very lazy & not at all inclined to
Muster so I went into the Gaol & wrote up my Diary instead. Polly took
Godfrey to see Mrs Smith. At about five o?clock there came on a glorious rain
which lasted for an hour or more, after which the weather cleared & there
was as fine a sunset as I have ever seen. Notwithstanding the heavy rain the
weather was still close & muggy. I went across & had a chat with Dr
Robertson about the English news. Polly came home at about eight o?clock
& then I went as far as the Club. There were several members present. After
a time Jardine Smith & I left together. We walked with one another to the
end of Swanston Street.
Bright a professed spiritualist & James Smith another, a little more so,
preached at the Unitarian Chapel to-day. 194 Bright on ?The Creation? &
Smith on the Religion of Shakspere. Bright preached in the morning &
Smith in the evening. The Divine origin of Jesus is totally denied by the
spiritualists & all creeds are declared to be vanities. Good works done help a
man both in this world & the one to come. Smith is wonderfully impressed
with the new power & states he is among the most favored of mortals,
receiving manifestations from Spirits of the highest spheres. He even went so
far as to say it is reported that he had a message from God himself. Poor
fellow ?Yarra Bend? on the brain I very much fear.
January 19 Friday 1872
This was an agreeable day & I felt very well & so able to enjoy it. Received a
letter from Mrs Smith & also two which I forwarded for Edwin, later
in the day one came for Edwin which had apparrently been part of the Mail
on Board of the Rangoon, forwarded that also. After I had got through
194 For the enthusiastic embrace of spiritualism (about which Castieau is clearly a sceptic), see
Lurline Stuart, James Smith: The Making of a Colonial Culture (Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 1989),
especially pp. 135-151, and Alfred Gabay, Messages from Beyond: Spiritualism and Spiritualists in
Melbourne's Golden Age 1870-1890 (Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press, 2001).


ordinary Gaol business I went to the Town Hall to get some money for road
metal, saw Cosgrove the City Treasurer who was very civil & invited me into
his office where he would insist on my having some refreshment. I took a glass
of sherry & a biscuit. Went to Mr Duncan?s office & paid in my collections.
The Inspector General was preparing to go to Portland so I only said Good
morning & did not trouble him further. Snelling was civil & so also was
Stone, the latter very obliging.
Mustered in the afternoon & in the evening took the usual walk to the
Club. Had a chat with Shillinglaw, Ogier & the new Editor of The Herald.
Began to talk Titchbourne 195 & afterwards New Guinea. Ogier it seems has an
objection to the Hotel people at the Club & invited us to have a glass of beer
with him at the Argus Hotel. I went for the chat was interesting. We went into
a nice comfortable room where we found Semple sitting. We chummed up of
course & New Guinea again came on the carpet. An Expedition has just
started from Sydney for the Coast of New Guinea. The adventurers intend
landing on the Coast if possible & if not to try something in the way of pearl
shell fishing. Shillinglaw considers the whole affair will be a failure & that if a
landing is made the natives will eat all the strangers to the soil. The Herald
Editor thought better of the enterprise & considered the Pearl Shell to fall
back upon would be a security against loss while if a peacable landing was
effected there would be a great chance as it was well known there was gold in
the country.
When I came home I played a game of Bezique with Polly & then went to bed.
January 20 Saturday 1872
Got up rather late, was however in the office by nine o?clock. More
suggestions & circulars from the Penal Office. In the course of the morning I
received a letter giving Mr McCall the Coup de Grace. He is to leave at the end
of the month & the Chief Secretary?s order is to be obeyed without further
correspondence. This is a blow to me for McCall was trustworthy & very
smart; his going away will I fear cause me trouble. In the afternoon I
mustered, when I came back to the house I was told there was a gentleman
waiting to see me. I found it was Mr Francis Nixon who was Editor of one of
the Beechworth Papers a very long time ago. He was of course hard up,
had?ent in fact food for his family, would I lend him a pound until next
Wednesday. I felt I should?ent get the money back & I knew I could?ent afford
to lose it yet I lent it. Nixon went away forcing an 1.0. U. upon me which I
have put away carefully in my Safe. There is one blessing; he is not likely to
come to see me again while I hold the proof of his indebtedness. When Nixon
195 The Tichborne case centred on the claims of an English inheritance by Arthur Orton, a
butcher from Wagga Wagga. It caused a popular sensation in the early 1870s in England
and Australia. See Michael Roe, Kenealy and the Tichborne Cause: A Study in Mid-Victorian
Populism (Carlton, Vic.: Melbourne University Press, 1974).


had gone away I went back to Polly who was chatting with Richard Warren
the proprietor of The Ovens and Murray Advertiser. When he went away Polly
& I had a little domestic difficulty about Nixon. Polly was right I know, but
she has a nasty way of nagging & keeping on at it. I got spiteful at last & just
as we were commencing tea I released the bile by violently smashing a plate
which of course I know was a very foolish thing to do. Went into town in the
evening, at the Club met Telo & Cane. Watched the people crowding into the
Town Hall to a concert, could see the Stage & hear some of the music at the
club window. Did?ent however stop to avail myself of the opportunity. Walked
into Bourke Street, hunted about for some time to get something nice for a
shilling for Dotty as it will be her birthday on Monday. Could?ent see
anything better than a bundle of Kisses so got them.
January 29 Monday 1872
Had more than a suspicion of bilious headache the whole of this day. In the
morning was obliged to go into the womens wing & hear a number of Cases
many of them trivial but still such as could not be passed over without giving
the turnkeys some excuse for laxity of discipline. I punished ten or twelve
women & among them two or three were very excited on receiving their
sentences & made the corridor resound with their threats & abuse. One
woman, Catherine McGuirk, a great creature nearly six feet high could scarcely
restrain herself from flying at Mrs Aspinall. That little woman however stood
with her arms akimbo ?as one who knoweth not?. McGuirk spoke daggers but
used none I am happy to say; her language was however a caution.
Mclnnery is very fond of me & I got a number of pet appellations
showered at me from the top of her voice. ?Little black devil? was about the
mildest. I wish Mr Duffy could spend a week at the Gaol & see what I have
to do. I feel certain I should get promotion without having to ask for it.
February 2 Friday 1872
Felt much better this morning than I have done for some time. Mrs Mathews
very sensible & almost cheerful. Charlie had passed a good night & she had
evidently a little rest which had made her feel better. 196 Received a cheque last
night for the pay so this morning 1 went to the Bank to get it cashed. The
weather was rather cold & unpleasantly dusty. Called at the Bank of N.S.
Wales & deposited a small sum to each of my accounts then went for the pay.
Came back & settled with the turnkeys, mustered. After Muster was thinking
of going into the fowl yard when I noticed a commotion in the house &
heard from Julia that the doctor was wanted immediately. I was about
sending for Dr Fitzgerald when Polly came running to me to ask me to go for
Dr Robertson. The doctor came over at once & we found little Charlie very
196 This episode relates to the illness and death of the child of family friends, the Mathews.


much worse, in fact the poor little fellow was dying. It was pitiful to see the
dear little fellow struggling for breath & apparently in a fright at not being able
to speak. The doctor went away after suggesting some little simple treatment to
endeavour to alleviate the boy?s sufferings, but he evidently knew human skill
was of no avail. I walked into the street with Dr Robertson. When I returned
Charlie was all but dead. I brought Dr Robertson back. He was powerless, life
was gone. Poor Mrs Mathews felt bitterly & quietly. She allowed the necessary
things to be done, then on her knees by the side of the corpse, she knelt for
hours. Charlie was the favorite of his father & mother. The little fellow looked
more angel than mortal when the placid expression of death came over his
features. His end was merciful, for with the disease he was laboring under, life
must have been a burden & suffering his lot while in the world.
I telegraphed to Mr Moffett of Albury to prepare Mathews & then I wrote
to Dr Cobbett & telegraphed to James Orr. Mathews got the news & sent
back a telegraph, thanking us & being thankful that Mrs Mathews was with
her son. Went to the Club & saw in an article in The Australian Journal a lot
about the Gaol & its iniquities purporting to be written by a discharged
prisoner. Bet Mr Wyatt a new hat that the Tichbourne claimant would never
get the estates.
February 3 Saturday 1872
Up tolerably early this morning & spent a busy day with one thing & another.
Sent for Mr Daley the Undertaker & he came pulling a very long face &
professionally grieved of course at having to provide for the funeral of poor
little Charlie Mathews. Telegraphed to Mathews that arrangements had been
made for the Funeral & shortly after received one from him which must have
crossed mine in which Mathews said the Echuca Coach would leave Echuca for
Albury on Monday at two & arrive the next evening at Albury, it would bring
Charlies remains if I thought it advisable to send them. Mrs Mathews most
anxious Charlie should be removed & Polly anxious to give her satisfaction. I
could not however conscientiously recommend it for it is a long time till
Tuesday & the sending the coffin by Railway to Echuca & then for thirty hours
in a Coach to Albury would I thought be too much to chance its arriving there
except in such a condition as to make it far from comforting to poor Charlie?s
relatives & friends. I Telegraphed however that ?Mrs Mathews wished removal,
can alter arrangements but will await another telegram?. The answer came,
?Better remain, risk too great? so the funeral will take place as arranged to-
morrow afternoon at three o?clock. Invited Messrs Keogh & Morison to the
funeral. Littlewood called this morning to see Mrs Mathews. He will attend. A
Wesleyan minister of Albury called & will preside at the funeral. Received a
telegram from James Orr. Mrs Mathews also had one. The coffin was brought
for Charlie this evening; it was very pretty. The poor little fellow looked very
peaceful in it. Harry feels Charlie?s death very much but says he is in a better


position than us & that he Harry dreamt Charlie came to him last night an
angel. Polly went to the Cemetary & selected a piece of ground. She has been
good through the whole trouble.
This morning I had to go into the Labor Yard to make enquiries about a
man who was found dead on the Railway at Emerald Hill & who was
supposed to have been in Gaol. As the man I suspected him to be had had
his boots mended I went to the shoemaker?s shop to see & noticed the
shoemaker on seeing me put down the work he had in his hand behind a
screen & took up a Government boot which he began working at. I looked
behind the screen & saw a pair of boots nearly finished, evidently intended
for some turnkey. The shoemaker would not tell who the boots were for but
I hope to find out.
Went to the Club in the afternoon, saw Marcus Clarke, he is not the Editor
of The Australian Journal now. I thought he was & wondered he had allowed the
article about the Gaol to appear. In the evening went into Melbourne with Polly
& Harry. The girls went to-day to stay at Dotty?s & the boys to Uncle Joe?s.
February 4 Sunday 1872
A very cool day, weather look changeable but the wet kept off. Went to
Church in the Gaol. In the afternoon punctually at three o?clock Mr Keogh
& his son, Mr Littlewood, Mr Morison & the Rev. Mr Watsford arrived. The
undertaker was also up to time & the remains of poor little Charlie were
taken to his last home. I paid at the Cemetary Office �3. 17. 0 for the ground
&c. 197 Everything was done quietly & nicely in connection with the funeral
& I hope that Mrs Mathews will soon get over the very deep grief she now
feels & begin to take nourishment; then I hope to see her get about a little &
pluck up for the sake of those she has left. Littlewood asked me to go to St
Kilda with him & I did so, though the Keoghs & Morison stopped to tea at
my house. It looked strange my going away but Polly insisted a change would
do me good & they all persuaded me to do so. Had a nice drive in
Littlewood?s trap to St Kilda, he & Mrs Littlewood have just returned from
Sydney where they had evidently enjoyed themselves very much. Mr & Mrs
Woolf were at Littlewood?s. Came away from Littlewood?s to catch the
quarter past eight o?clock train. On the way from Littlewoods I ran up
against a gentleman & without looking at him asked the nearest way to the
Station. He smiled & then I saw it was Wyburn. Went to the Club where I
saw Dr Avent, Dr Gilbee, Levy & Telo. Did not stop long but came home.
Mrs Littlewood [should be Mrs Mathews] was chatting with Polly & a little
more cheerful. If she would only take a little nourishment she would soon be
herself again. She has taken Harry into her confidence & they had a long
confab about Charlie & his belongings.
197 Castieaus accounts for the year suggest that he paid for the child's burial plot at St Kilda Cemetery.


February 5 Monday 1872
Mr Sturt came to the Gaol this afternoon. I brought a shoemaker before him
who had been caught making a pair of boots on ?the cross? or in plain English,
secretly. I expected the boots were intended for one of the turnkeys. It was
not without some difficulty I could bring the Magistrate to see the man had
done much wrong. However after a time he sentenced the prisoner to an
extra month.
If Mr Sturt knew the evils of ?cross work? as well as I do, he would know how
necessary it is to make an example when any one doing it is caught, as the man
was, red-handed. If turnkeys employ prisoners to do work for them secretly
they bring themselves at once to the level of the prisoners & lose all control.
Prisoners do not work on ?the cross? for nothing & the turnkey who employs
them must pay in some way or other either by giving tobacco or visiting friends
or taking out letters or bringing in contraband articles. One officer in a gaol
thus false to his duties will while he is undiscovered upset the efforts of
Governor, or the best system. The offending officer is not easily discovered
while he keeps his own council as it is a point of honor among thieves not to
peach upon a ?screw? under the circumstances and so, as in this case, the
prisoner declines to tell who he was working for & says it is best for himself to
be punished. ?lt was the first time he had ever done anything etc. etc.?
Went to the Club in the evening. Met Reed the Architect, 158 came home,
found Polly up & better. Had a chat with her & Mrs Mathews then went to bed.
February 9 Friday 1872
Another nice cool day. Polly & Mrs Mathews went to Elsternwick together.
Mrs Mathews went to the cemetary the first thing in the morning. Busy in
the Gaol all the morning. Mustered in the afternoon. In the evening went to
the Club & on the Road called in at the Albion as I wanted to see The Ovens
and Murray Advertiser &my letter if it had been published. 199 After some
trouble I found the paper I wanted & my letter in it, though in very small
type. The type I would?ent have minded but I was very much annoyed in
finding two or three paragraphs I did?ent write were put into the letter above
the signature I used on this, as on other occasions. In my letter (as in duty
bound) I studiously avoided all reference to politics & am therefore disgusted
that the clever individual who took upon himself to lengthen my letter had
inserted a paragraph of advice to the Chief Secretary. There was another
paragraph about a Wesleyan meeting of some kind or another, a subject
198 Joseph Reed (1823??1890), the architect who designed many Melbourne landmarks
including the Melbourne Town Hall, the Exhibition Building and a number of city
churches ( Australian Dictionary of Biography) . There are earlier mentions in the diary
indicating that Castieau knew him in part from Reed s friendship with George Wintle,
the first sheriff of Melbourne and Castieau's superior.
199 Castieau continued as an occasional correspondent with the Beechworth paper after his
return to Melbourne.


which I certainly should?ent feel tempted to tackle. I think myself badly
treated in this matter & shall tell Warren so the first opportunity I have of
letting him know my feelings on the subject. Polly & Mrs Mathews were
home before I got there. Mr Ingomells Harry?s schoolmaster came to-day to
ask that Harry might join the Latin class. 1 said I did?ent mind his doing so
but that I found the boy had no application & that it was difficult to make
him do what he had to do of English. Mr Ingomells however wished the boy
should try the Latin so I consented that he should do so.
February 10 Saturday 1872
The weather still pleasant & particularly agreeable for this time of the year.
Polly & Mrs Mathews went for Trotty & brought her from School. Busied
myself about the Gaol till past one o?clock, then 1 went into the house & was
thinking of having some dinner when I was told Mr Duncan was in the Gaol
& so I left at once to attend upon ?the head of the department?. Mr Duncan
did the grimly amiable, transacted some business in the office & then went
through the Gaol. He found fault with some of the cells & was shocked at
seeing the stains of recently slaughtered bugs upon some of the walls.
Notwithstanding the Inspector General, I was much satisfied myself with the
appearance of the Gaol & should not mind its being gone through by any
persons however well up they may be in penal arrangements. I noticed an
inclination on the part of Mr Duncan to curry favor with the prisoners. If I
were to yield as he was inclined to do, there would be a large addition to the
Staff soon required. Did not muster this afternoon & did not go out either
until after tea. Mrs Castieau, Mrs Mathews & some of the children with
Trotty Gray as a visitor went to the Library. In the evening they went to the
Waxworks & I took a turn at the Club, met Mr Eville, Mr Miles & Mr
Duerdin; went at Eville?s request into the Hotel & had a glass of beer, met
Polly & the family, went through the Royal Arcade & then to Paddy?s
Market. Got home at about half past ten o?clock. The children all tired, they
however managed supper before they retired to bed. Wrote to Mathews this
morning. Mrs Mathews had a letter.
February 14 Wednesday 1872
This was a close & muggy day. Did usual work in the office. In the afternoon
there was the disagreeable business of flogging; this was the first sentence of
the kind inflicted under the Criminal Statutes Amendment Act which
empowers Magistrate [s] to sentence flogging for indecent exposure. The
fellow punished to-day was a cur & behaved like one.
Partially mustered when I was sent for by Mr Sturt, & transacted some little
business with him, then went in to tea. In the evening went to the Club & after
reading the papers took a walk & then came home. Was home before Polly &
Mrs Mathews who had gone for a stroll, smoked a pipe & went to bed.


By the afternoon?s Post I received a Valentine & by no means a sentimental
one either. It represented me as a happy parent blessed with a good wife, who
had just presented me with twins which in the picture the nurse was
exhibiting with great satisfaction. What was meant for me was loaded with
children up to all kinds of noise & devilment & who were evidently too
much for the unfortunate depicted as their father. It was very good & we all
enjoyed the caricature which spoke home but yet left no sting. Dotty & Sissy
got their Valentines in due course & Harry received a penny to console him
for not getting a Valentine as well as his sisters. With his penny Harry bought
a Valentine representing a hideous monster pounding drugs in a mortar. This
he sent to the family Apothecary as being appropriate.
February 15 Thursday 1872
Up this morning at about the usual time. The Criminal Sittings commenced
to-day & I spent most of my time there though I took a cab in the morning
& went to the Treasury & the Town Hall at each of which places I drew some
money for the Government. Saw John Hall & he invited me into his sanctum
where I sat down & had a chat while my papers were being got ready. As I
was journeying to the Treasury I passed another cab which contained John
Turner of Beechworth. We were going in different directions so we gracefully
saluted & saw no more of each other. Mustered in the afternoon. In the
evening went as usual to the Club & after skimming some of the English
periodicals went for a little stroll with Duerdin. Got a letter from Mrs Smith
in which she said my father had been ill but was recovering. Bought a novel
to night, Memoirs of a Physician by Dumas. 200 Ido not think I have read it &
if I have not, expect some few hours quiet entertainment from its perusal.
Wrote a letter to Alderdice & sent him the letter that had been published by
The Ovens and Murray Advertiser & signed ?Quits?, told him what I had not
written of it & asked him to let any one know who had any idea I signed
?Quits?. Polly & Mrs Robertson had a little bit of a rumpus for which I am
very sorry. They met to night & I thought had squared matters, it appears
however each holds to the opinion that her own children cannot do wrong
& that other people?s children can.
February 27 Tuesday 1872
Went into the Court this morning & stayed until some prisoners were
sentenced and a charge of Fraudulent Insolvency commenced. At one o?clock
went into the court again to hear the Judgment in Capt. Collard case
delivered. 201 A number of witnesses to character were called who all gave the
Captain the highest character both as a seaman & a commander. Judge
200 Alexandre Dumas, Memoirs of a Physician , of which several English editions were published
from 1846.
201 Collard was charged over the wreck of the Sussex at Barwon Heads (see Diary, 1 January 1872),


Barry delivered a long judgment which as usual was see-saw fashion; at one
moment I fancied the prisoner would get the heaviest sentence it was in the
power of the Judge to inflict, then a little further on I considered the Judge
intended to inflict a nominal penalty, afterwards again that the Captain was
in for a severe punishment, then again that he would get off lightly after all.
Finally the judge sentenced him to one month?s imprisonment, this after the
solemn peroration of the Judge tickled the fancy of some one in the Gallery
& caused him to sneer very audibly. I pitied the poor Captain for really he
seemed most terribly cut up & when he went into the back room I saw it was
with difficulty he kept back the scalding tears. I shook hands with him & bid
him keep up his heart. He told me & I believed it, that he honestly did his
duty & to the best of his ability on the night of the wreck, that he did not
watch in hand, time the light for it was very unusual to do so, but that he did
mentally do so. He attributed the misfortune entirely to the fires lighted by
picnic parties on the Barwon Heads. I did all I could for the captain & put
him in the debtors ward of the prison. Mr Smyth the Crown Prosecutor
brought the Mate to see the Captain & I permitted him to do so.
February 29 Thursday 1872
Up early this morning & took a good look through the Gaol before breakfast.
Was in the office at my work sharp by nine o?clock & remained until, at a
little after eleven o?clock, Mr Duncan put in an appearance. Went with him
through the Cook-house & women?s wing. He was then obliged to go away.
After lunch I went to the Sheriff?s Office & wished to see the Sheriff. He was
in Court & so I had to push my way through a crowd who were eagerly
sucking in the indecent details of the case of Clarson V Blair. Mrs Clarson
was in the witness box the whole of the day & the letters she had written were
produced & acknowledged by her on her examination.
The general impression is that she was criminally intimate with Dr Blair &
became almost insane with jealousy when the doctor took unto himself a wife
& dispensed with further favors from herself. It is surprising to me to see so
many people who waste or spend their time at the Court when there is any
sexual matter gone into. I should be ashamed to be seen unless it was my
business to be present, which 1 am thankful to say it is not. Mrs Clarson owned
to being 50 years of Age so the gushing sweet? must have been about 43 when
she used to sign herself when writing to the doctor ?Your devoted little Carrie?.
March 1 Friday 1872
Up early again this morning & went into the Gaol. About the establishment until
breakfast time. Very busy all the morning until I received a Cheque for the pay,
then I went to the Bank & got the money. There was a Flogging this afternoon
but owing I suppose to the superior attractions of Clarson V Blair there was not
the usual crowd; only one reporter put in an appearance. John Dunn the


Comedian got an order from me. Altogether there were only three persons
besides the officials present & this I certainly think a decided improvement upon
the crowd that usually assembles to see the flagellator do his degrading work.
Captain Coffey & Mr Siddely of W.P. White & Co. came up to see Captn.
Collard. I gave them admission after some grumbling telling them they should
get orders from Mr Duffy or some other ?great man? & not throw the
responsibility of breaking the Gaol Regulations on my shoulders. When Captn.
Coffey was going out he asked me if I could do a glass of wine & I replied I
had no time, he said well then can you give us one. I answered rather hastily
but truly that I could?ent. The Captn. was a little taken aback but I smoothed
down my rudeness & we parted all right the Captain saying there was always
claret at his office. I said it was?ent my fault there was?ent any at mine.
March 6 Wednesday 1872
The weather still most uncomfortably hot, was obliged to go to the Supreme
Court this morning as I was subpoenaed to provide some papers in the Case
of ?Warr V Templeton? for False Imprisonment. Mustered in the afternoon.
In the evening Mr Fallon came up for Mrs Mathews & Polly & took them
to the Opera. I went to the Club & after a chat took a walk with Duerdin.
The night was hot but not so uncomfortably so as last night. It was however
quite hot enough &, as I have before remarked on this subject, a good deal
to spare into the bargain.
There was another highly sensational occurrence took place yesterday. Two
men who had been warders in the Hospital & discharged for drunkenness
professed an almost or quite a romantic affection for each other & feeling
disappointed with the world made up their minds to leave it together. After
plentifully partaking of Colonial wine they went into the Park armed with
horse pistols which were intended for use one against the other, not out of
animosity but in brotherly love, trusting their shades would fly to the same
sphere & there be united. It appears that they stood face to face each with a
pistol to the other?s breast. By some accident however only one fired, twas
however with deadly effect for the man shot at fell dead on the ground. The
assassin?s pistol burst and slightly injured him. When the Police arrived, one
man was lying dead & the other lying down calmly smoking. When
interrogated he said ?he meant to have shot me? & then relighted his cigar &
treated the crowd with philosophical nonchalance. 202
March 12 Tuesday 1872
Up early this morning & about the Gaol before breakfast. There were 160 men
in the Labor Yard which number is far more than can be properly worked. Very
202 The sensational case of these two male lovers, Edward Feeney (the survivor of the shooting,
later hanged) and Charles Marks, was reported at length in The Argus, 6 March 1872,
pp. 5-6: Castieau's account is clearly drawn from this source. See Diary, 13-14 May 1872
for Feeney's conviction and hanging.


busy all the morning with correspondence of one kind & another. In the
afternoon two men were flogged, a chinaman & a boy. The chinaman had 20
lashes & the boy 12 lashes. There was great howling & Bamford did his work
most efficiently. After the Chinamans howling it was with some pride I saw the
youth of the ?pale faces? coming up jauntily to the triangles & I thought to
myself of the triumph of blood & the superiority of the races. Young Australia
however roared more lustily than even John Chinaman.
Got very tired & shirked muster. Went to the Club where I stayed for a time
& then walked home with Jardine Smith. In the evening went again to the
Club where I smoked two or three cigars with Duerdin & Levey, then had a
chat with Cope & Ogier who had just come in from the theatre. They both
spoke most contemptuously of the performance. Shortly after this Dr Gilbee
reported that he had been to hear the Rev. Mr Onions lecture on Napoleon 3rd
& that he had been very much entertained. Duerdin & I left the Club together
& walked up Bourke Street. Then I came home & had a little barney in a
pleasant way with Polly before I went to bed. There was no appearance of
turnkey Foy to-day so I suppose he has taken the sulks at what was said to him
yesterday, or else that he is really ill. I know that the officers are a continual
bother & that if I had absolute power I would soon make a change.
March 15 Friday 1872
Was up very early this morning & saw the men on parade at six o?clock. Read
a circular to them about the appointment of one of the Gaol officers to give
evidence before the Civil Service Commission. 203 Only one witness is
required, the matter has created a deal of barneying & the democratic
element has been very busy endeavouring to get a turnkey selected instead of
myself or some other well known officer.
Had a letter from Gale, it was however only on Gaol business. Two Warders
were sent in this morning from Pentridge to render assistance during the
sitting of the Criminal Court. I went into the Labor Yard in the dinner hour
& in Draper?s office found turnkey Meadway sitting smoking & Draper
sitting opposite, the pair evidently engaged in some very interesting
discussion. The men that Meadway was in charge of were left to look after
themselves. This Meadway is a man that I have suspected of trafficking for a
long time past & I am convinced from what I saw to-day that he is a very
dangerous man to have about. He is a great lawyer in his way & has always
some grievance or another; he was I believe proposed by some of the men as
the most fitting representative that could be selected to give evidence before
the Civil Service Commission. I did not muster but went down to the Club
in the evening. Had a short walk with Duerdin then came home & after a
smoke went off to bed. This has been a very unsatisfactory day & I feel a

Public Service and the working of the Civil Service Act (Vic.). It delivered its findings in 1873.


bilious fit coming on again & know I shall not be all right until I get it over.
Was hunting for Cockle?s pills tonight but could only find one which I
swallowed greedily.
March 19 Tuesday 1872
In the Gaol office this morning at nine o?clock & was tolerably busily occupied
when Mr Duncan came into the office apparently not expecting to find me at
work. We had a long talk about the officers & the hours they had to remain on
Night Duty. Mr Duncan appeared wonderfully good all at once or else he has
got remarkably funky of his position for he was remarkably liberal in his talk and
wished me at once to report the number of extra men it would require to enable
the turnkeys all to have an hour?s leave for breakfast & an hour?s leave for dinner
& to be on duty only nine hours at night. I told him I?d let him know. Turnkey
Meadway was brought before him for his misconduct on Friday. Meadway
showed himself the sneaking humbug I have always considered him to be &
whined about my having a down upon him & that really it was so hard for the
turnkeys! He was certainly shut up in the shop to have a smoke but on his honor
he had never spoke to Draper all the time, he had?ent really. Mr Duncan fined
him fifteen shillings only & of course sent the wretch away inwardly laughing
& outwardly smirking at the easy way in which he had got off. He richly
deserved dismissal but Mr Duncan does?ent feel his feet very secure in his Gaol
shoes & wants to make the officers believe he is all that is good & gracious; he
is not wise however but thinks himself to be so. He showed his little cunning by
endeavouring to satisfy me with the assurance that by & by we should be able
to sack these fellows without any one being able to say a word against it.
March 20 Wednesday 1872
Could not sleep this night and at about one o?clock was urged to get up &
go into the Gaol. Did so & found all apparently correct. While in the New
Wing Leyden who was on Duty told me there was a large fire raging in town
& that it appeared so near he thought it must be the Hospital.
I went into town & found it was the Theatre Royal which by the time
I got to Bourke Street was utterly destroyed. No one could account for the
disaster though it was attributed in some degree to a large quantity of
inflammable materials that had been left about after being used for the
representation of a Fire in The Streets of New York, the name of the piece last
played on this so long famed Stage. I saw Coppin standing smoking a cigar
at a bar counter. He looked rather glum but I daresay there will be plenty
inclined to believe the fire is but another of George?s dodges.
Went to bed but was up again at half past five though I felt very queer & bad.
Went & read a letter that had been sent about the Leave. The turnkeys were
evidently very glum & have been airing their grievances. Meadway is
understood to be their chosen representative & I wish them joy of him. I felt


queer all day & little inclined in the afternoon to muster so after going all
through the Gaol I went into Melbourne where I went & had a good look at
the ruins. They brought to my recollection lots of old associations & made me
quite ready to yarn about them & hear others yarn also. Stayed doing so till
very late when a great trouble overtook me for I was seized with an attack of
diarrhoea occasioned I suppose by my drinking claret which I had done to keep
sober. I went home feeling very uncomfortable & was ill again in the night.
March 22 Friday 1872
In the office & at my work sharp this morning. The Turnkeys selected
Turnkey Meadway as the officer they wished to represent them before the
Civil Service Commission. I sent in the list of Meadway?s believers & at the
same time the list of those who had confidence in me. This comprised the
Clerks, Senior Turnkeys, Overseer of Labor, Matron & seven of the most
reliable of the turnkeys. I pointed out that an ordinary turnkey could not well
represent the officers & that I trusted if a Turnkey was called upon to give
evidence I should also have an opportunity of giving my testimony as it
should be valuable from my long experience both in Town & Country.
The Visiting Justice went all through the Gaol & as 1 accompanied him I
did not consider it necessary to go round again at Muster time. However I
was in the office at work until some time after the Muster was finished.
In the evening the children were very anxious for me to take them out & at
last I consented; Harry, Sissy, Dotty & Walter of my own & Flory Morphy. We
all went to the Menagerie & had quite a night of excitement. The lion & lioness
are really a fine pair of animals & the entry into their cell of a man & woman
was very exciting to the feelings; both performers, especially the woman I
fancied seemed much pleased to get outside again. However they repeated their
performance two or three times during the evening. The children & to tell the
truth, myself as well were highly delighted at a comical little cuss of a monkey
who dressed as a danseuse imitated humanity wonderfully well & went through
the usual antics of a tight rope dancer. After this the same, or another monkey
dressed as a gymnast went through the usual routine of a trapeze performer.
Both monkeys when they had done anything smart applauded themselves by
clapping their paws together in a very human-like way. There was a panorama
& there was tumbling & lots of other things for our money, so we all came home
well satisfied & rendered quite happy with a shillings worth of lollies.
Marcus Clarke sent Cousins up this afternoon to see if I would cash a
cheque for him for �lO. The cheque was not to be presented till Monday the
25th. 1 sent Clarke the money.
March 23 Saturday 1872
In the office this morning as usual & busy at one thing & another all the
morning. A tolerably quiet day at the Gaol. Mustered in the afternoon, in the


evening went to the Club then took a walk up Bourke Street, bought The
Australasian & came home. Had a smoke & a chat with Polly & then she
went to bed while I continued smoking for a time & when my pipe was out
went to the Front Gate where Magree was on duty & began talking with him.
Magree was one of the turnkeys who wished me to represent them at the
Civil Service Commission & I was rather surprised at it for I should have
imagined he would probably be one of the disaffected. Magree told me a
great deal of the fancied grievances of the turnkeys & of their opinion of my
disregard for their interests. Meadway appears to be a great authority & is
supposed to be possessed of wonderful influence. He is to shine grandly when
before the Board. Kelly, another of the turnkeys, seems also to be particularly
friendly to me & works with Meadway in his efforts for the benefit of
humanity & turnkey humanity in particular. My sins are I found out, of the
blackest die, for instance in a lecture I delivered I made the observation that
?Governors should have some choice in the selection of turnkeys?. This is
raked up against me now & I am reported to be in favor of Turnkeys being
appointed & dismissed by the Governors of Gaols. I plead Guilty to some
extent & believe if Governors themselves were selected for their fitness there
is nothing that would sooner tend to self supporting & properly conducted
Gaols than conducting them on commercial principles & trusting the
Governors or Managers of them with the same powers that business men
would give to those who had the control of establishments where profit was
to be made by time being saved & a system observed.
?I wanted to stop the turnkeys? leave? is another charge made against me. This
is simply false & Meadway & Co. know it, but what boots it going on further
Jack?s as good as his master & a little better under the present Democratic state
of affairs. What business then have I got to be Governor & Meadway & Kelly
only turnkeys. Down with Castieau & let them rule week about.
The coming immediately after Mr Wintle would have been a grand
opportunity for a man who would have puffed himself at the expense of the
old man but I could not do that & I took the Gaol with all its dirt & iniquity,
& cleansing out an Augean stable it has proven to be, & great has been the
disfavor with which the job has been seen progress by those who preferred
living in the old state of dirt & confusion.
March 29 Friday 1872
This being Good Friday was altogether observed as a holiday in the Gaol.
Polly took the children to the Royal Park & Mrs Mathews & Trotty Gray went
with them. I did some writing in the office. Good Friday was not kept as a
holy day publicly in Melbourne. It was a day people went out to enjoy
themselves & with no thought as a Rule of the solemnity of the anniversary
which caused the suspension of business. The Volunteers went to Brighton to
tackle the enemy who went on before them in Special Trains & as the weather
had taken up there was all that was wanted to ensure success for the Review


unless the officers blundered. I am afraid if they did our soldiers would ?reason
why & make reply? as well. In the evening Polly & the youngsters went with
me to the Railway Station to see the soldiers returning from the battle. They
did not all get back till nearly nine o?clock. We waited for more than an hour
for one train. When it did come there was something in return for the time
we had spent, for the soldiers fell in behind a good band which went off to the
barracks playing some most inspiriting music. Mr Duncan came to-day
between one & two o?clock. Rather a strange day & a strange hour for him to
choose for his inspection, however I was about & things were tolerably ship
shape though we were as short handed as we well could be, there being only
ten men on duty in the Gaol, the remainder being away on Leave.
March 30 Saturday 1872
Received notice this morning that I was to attend to give evidence before the
Civil Service Commission on Thursday next. Got one or two letters from the
Up-Country Gaols with suggestions. A letter of a rather unpleasant character
reached me also from the Bank in which I was informed that a cheque of
Marcus Clarke?s which I had paid into my credit had been dishonoured. I
went to the Library & found Marcus. He expressed his regret & gave me the
cash which I confess I was very glad indeed to get. Judge Bindon was with
Clarke when I went to his office. The old fellow seemed particularly grumpy.
Mr Sturt the V.I. was at the Gaol this morning. He tried one woman for
insolence but let her off, which perhaps was as well as she would have made
a row if punished & that would have been unpleasant in holiday time &
when the officers were short handed. Took the little girls to Elsternwick
where I remained to lunch & came home in the afternoon about four o?clock.
Had a great game of romps with the boys in the Play-ground, Godfrey doing
great tricks on the swing & Harry & Walter trying to compete with him.
Took Polly & Trotty to the theatre to night to see the Opera of Orphee aux
Enfers. 204 It was brought out for the first time this evening & proved a great
success. The scenery & the dresses were very good indeed & though there
were one or two little hitches & Lascelles who played Orpheus did?ent know
his part yet, on the whole the Piece went wonderfully well for a first night.
Stewart played Jupiter very well indeed & Miss Hattie Shepherd made a good
Queen of Heaven. The naughty Eurydice was played by Miss May who was
in good voice & much applauded. Miss Easdown had a good part but seemed
nervous & did?ent make the most of her voice. Rainford played Cerberus &
got much applause for the song which he sings in that character. The Cricket
Match with Sydney commenced to-day. Victoria so far has been victorious.
204 Offenbach's opera, produced in the economical style of musical theatre. Castieau's response
might have been prompted by reading Neild's review, which commented of such new
productions, 'First, there is the opening night when everybody is in good spirits, and
deficiencies are not perceived, or are amiably ignored' (Love, James Edward Neild: Victorian
Virtuoso , p. 293).


April 14 Sunday 1872
Polly?s finger was very sore this morning & I had to get it dressed for her
before she could feel at all comfortable with it. She did not feel at all
inclined for Church so I took four of the youngsters myself. When we were
coming out we met Polly with the three others & came home altogether. In
the afternoon I mustered & then had a barney with Polly about the pigs,
whether one or both should be killed to-morrow. I got cross & used cross
language & we made a mess of it between us. Polly went out & I was left
alone in my glory for after tea Julia went out with a friend & I had all the
youngsters in my own charge. We got on however capitally for I found a nice
story in Chatterbot which I read, much to the edification of us all, & after
that at the girls? request after Walter & Godfrey had been put to bed Harry,
Sissy, Dotty & I read a couple of chapters out of the New Testament taking
each a verse in turn. When we had finished the youngsters were tired & ready
for bed so I let them go & read away at the Weekly Papers till Polly came
home which she did at a little after nine o?clock. Went to bed soon after but
did not get to sleep for a long time as since I have left off drinking Spirits I
have been troubled with dyspepsia & cannot but feel very restless. I hope
however the feeling will not last many days longer & certainly in spite of the
indigestion I feel better without the drink than with it.
April 15 Monday 1872
Was up this morning in time to inspect the officers on Parade. The Criminal
Sittings commenced this morning, Mr O?Laughlan prosecuting instead of
Mr Dunn, promoted to the County Court Bench. Stayed at the Court a
considerable portion of the day & instead of mustering walked into town
with young Mr Molesworth who has a number of Cases at the Sittings &
who is looked upon as a rising young barrister. We talked principally
concerning the remarkable case of a man named Feeny who is to be defended
by Molesworth. It is one of the most extraordinary Cases on record. Two men
named Feeney & Marks [refer also to 6 March 1872 entry] were on the most
intimate terms professing the greatest affection for each other, (their intimacy
was very strongly expected to go to the extent of a criminal nature). They
appear for some reason or other to have become disgusted with this world &
determined to leave it but at the same time, with the cursed love of other
men?s astonishment which most like to create, they determined their death
should be sensational. Procuring a brace of pistols they made their plans as to
the use of them & then went to a photographer whom they employed to
depict them standing opposite each other, each holding a pistol & that
pistol touching the other?s heart. It does not appear whether or no the
photographer thought he had hold of strange customers but at any rate he
205 The Chatterbox, an English children's story magazine, published from 1866 and issued
weekly as well as an annual.


took their likenesses in the manner described & has no doubt made
something out of the negative which then became his own. After the portrait
taking which was apparently but a rehearsal of an intended tragedy, Messrs
Feeney & Marks seem to have gone together to one of the parks or rather
gardens & here stood as they had been represented in the photograph. All
that is however really known is this, that a report was heard, that persons
went to know the cause of it & found Marks lying dead, Feeney lying
opposite to him quietly smoking a cigar & between the two a loaded pistol.
Whether Feeney fired his pistol too quickly for his friend or whether the
other lost nerve & could not fire his no eye saw & none but Feeney knows.
He was of course arrested & is to be tried for murder. Both he & Marks have
previously attempted suicide. Here is material for a Sensational Novel who
dare use it.
April 16 Tuesday 1872
Up as usual this morning & in the office at nine o?clock. Was rather worried
with a memo. I got from the Penal Office prohibiting my continuing to give
a pot of tea to prisoners who were employed at night on urgent work. I
thought as there had been only an expenditure of 3/8 & the men who had
had the tea had done many pounds worth of work this was coming it rather
too strong so I wrote an indignant memo, regretting the Inspector General
should think it advisable to interfere with me in such trifling matters &c &c
&c. I daresay I shall get a hot reply but there is a time when even a worm will
turn & as I hope I am not quite that yet I think there is an excuse for me
showing my teeth even though it is useless biting at a file. I wonder whether
a file of papers was meant in the fable. A file of this kind protected by red
tape is sometimes enough to grind down the sharpest teeth at any rate.
April 17 Wednesday 1872
Up at usual time this morning & after attending to ordinary Gaol business
went to the Court where the first Case that was gone into was that of Feeney
for the shooting in the Gardens. The prisoner was found Guilty & sentenced
to Death. Judge Williams in passing sentence remarked that ?lf the two men
went out with the avowed intention of killing one another it was a cowardly
thing on the part of the prisoner when he found he had effected his purpose
& his companion had not been able to do so not to take the loaded pistol
that remained & blow his own brains out?. The Judge said he thought this
remark would affect the prisoner more than any other he could make, but
though the same idea had flashed across my own mind I hardly think it was
quite the sentiment to proceed from the Bench. Mustered in the afternoon
& in the evening went to the Club, walked home & on getting there found
a letter from Edwards inviting me to meet Neild & Hickling & to have a chat
about old times at his house between nine & ten this evening. Went, much


to Polly?s disgust, & on arriving at the house found Mrs Edwards all alone. Jack
came in about a quarter of an hour afterwards & by and by Neild & Hickling
put in an appearance. We had some supper & what with reminiscences &
gossip, the time flew swiftly away & it was not till one o?clock we broke up,
although I had been trying to get off for an hour before that.
Walked down town with Hickling & at the old Bar of the Theatre Royal
went in to oblige Hickling by taking a parting drink. I stuck to the non
intoxicating fluids & called for claret. After a time some was produced which
on gulping down I found to be tolerably fair vinegar. Having advised the
barman to label it as such & so avoid mistakes for the future (there is no
knowing how long the bottle might last as Melbourne folk are not much
given to claret) I said good bye to Hickling & went straight for home. Polly
was sitting up indignant & I got some hard words, however as I was perfectly
sober I believe she rather admired me than otherwise. Went to bed, to kick,
but not to sleep. Cold beef, Salad, cheese, Pine apple &c had possession of
my chest & trampled on it the whole night through.
April 19 Friday 1872
At luncheon time this morning Mr Ware of the Chief Secretary?s office went
over the Gaol with me. I was not at all pleased with the Labor Yard &
considered the men were idling away their time pretty much as they pleased.
Must bully Hackett to-morrow. There was to be a meeting of the delegates
who had been chosen to give evidence before the Civil Service Commission
to be held this afternoon at the Crown Lands Office. The Meeting was
convened by Mr Clement Hodgkinson. Ellis & I went down together & on
arriving at the office found the Meeting had commenced. There were about
twenty persons present among whom was turnkey Meadway. It was soon
apparent that no business of any consequence would be transacted. A
resolution was carried that a Committee of Classified & Unclassified Officers
should be appointed ?to settle the affairs of the Service?, but when they were
about to elect this Committee I expressed the opinion that the meeting no
more represented the Civil Service than the three tailors did the people of
England & advocated an adjournment. Ellis fell in with my view & moved
an adjournment of the meeting until the chairman considered it advisable to
re-summon it. I seconded this & it was carried so no mischief was done. In
the evening went to the Club where I met Duerdin & went for a walk with
him. We went through the Flagstaff Gardens, up by the Mint, passed the
meat market & down Elizabeth Street into Bourke Street, then said ?good
night? & went off home. Harriette called to-day & was very jolly with Polly
& the children. Mrs Stephen called for her & left Cards of Mr Stephen. 206
206 Harriette was employed as a governess by the Stephens. James Wilberforce Stephen was a
wealthy lawyer and MLA for St Kilda from 1870, and from June 1872 he was Attorney-
General in the Francis ministry.


April 21 Sunday 1872
Had rather a queer night?s rest having been troubled a good deal with dispepsia.
I wondered at this as to avoid it I took some carbonate of soda last night
thinking I was suffering from acidity of the stomach. Got up & began chaffing
Polly who got out of temper & gave me a severe talking to. Went to Church
with Polly & all the children save John & the baby. At dinner time had a
disappointment as a cheek of one of the pigs killed last week & which we
expected would prove a treat turned out to be bad & uneatable. I was funking
for the whole of the pork but Polly accounted for the head being queer because
the butcher had hit the pigs on the head to stun before he killed them. I
sincerely hope she is right in her judgment.
After dinner went out for a walk & a short distance from our house met
Duerdin so we strolled away together. We went over Princes Bridge &
inspected the site of the Governor?s new house, the foundations of which are
being laid. The situation for the building is airy & will command a fine view.
After this we went to the Botanical Gardens & span out a very pleasant walk
till six o?clock, when after looking in at the Yorick we separated. Home to tea,
more unpleasant arguments & had words about little or nothing, myself I must
acknowledge most to blame. In the evening, Polly read to the children & then
gave them a Bible lesson. Before the lesson commenced I came into the office
& wrote up my Diary. It is wonderful how happy some youngsters are in some
of the remarks they make. Our Harry aged ten is not by any means a bright
looking youth & is as clumsy in his manner & careless in his habits as any brat
of his age well could be, still he is fond of reading & recollects very well many
of the things he does read. To-day at dinner there was fowl & bacon. I noticed
Harry left all the fat of the bacon & doing the Paterfamilias reproached him for
it. With a self possession for which I envied the rogue, he looked me in the face
& said grandly, You know Papa, ?Twas fat, not fate by which Napoleon fell?. I
did?ent know, but I could?ent help inwardly grinning & Mrs C she laughed
outright & evidently thought no small beer of her eldest born. A couple of
Reporters interviewed me with regard to the goings on of Feeney under
sentence of Death. I had however nothing to tell them beyond the facts of his
being much the same as he was before he received the sentence. They can
however make a paragraph of that & I suppose that is all they require, though
of course one with a little sensation in it would please better than one without
anything in it to make the gentle public roar.
Have got through this week without taking any spirits & though I have not
slept well at nights yet have felt in the day time better without the grog &
believe I have looked a great deal better also.
April 27 Saturday 1872
This morning felt very much better though when I went into the office &
read my letters I did not feel in very good spirits. There was a Circular from


Duncan stating that after the first of the month no work would be allowed
& another calling upon me to state the number of Domestic Servants that
were employed by the officers & the Authority under which they were
employed. I wrote a reply to the latter & occupied myself nearly the whole
day in writing a letter to the Chief Secretary asking for promotion. Went
into town in the evening & called at the Yorick. There I remained reading
for some time, then I took a walk as far as Spencer Street Railway Station,
came back to Swanston Street, met Polly & after a stroll into the Eastern
Market went home, took some more brandy & water & went off to bed.
The stopping our allowances will make a great difference to our comfort &
if we do not get our Washing done for us the extra expense will be very
serious indeed. I hope yet however that Washing will be considered as part
of the services of ordinary Servants & if so we shall get it done by those
allowed to us. I wish sincerely I was in a position to abstain from having
anything to do with the Gaol beyond my duty & certainly as soon as it is
distinctly settled as to what we are allowed I shall be enabled more freely to
do my duty & be independent.
April 29 Monday 1872
In the office as usual & did ordinary work. Polly went to see Joe White but
did not find him at home. She however met with a kind reception from Miss
White & went up again in the afternoon to see Joe. He promised he would
do all in his power to help us & I really believe he will. In the afternoon was
Mustering when I was joined by Mr Duncan. He went round the Gaol with
Spencer Street Station c. 1880

me & then when we had got back to the office became communicative. He
told me he had recommended my Application strongly. This took the wind
out of my sails entirely & I blurted out, ?I am much obliged to you for I really
did?ent think you would?. This led to his asking the reason why & I had my
little grievances out & made a clean breast of everything. Duncan assured me
the Chief Secretary was to blame in the matters which I attributed to him
(Duncan). The matter of the ?refuse food? was caused by some tittle tattle at
Geelong about Gibson?s poultry & it was?ent even known that I used the
refuse or had poultry. 207 1 said I had had two pigs but that they were killed &
I should have no more. With regard to prison labor Duncan said that he had
recommended some compensation to the officers who had been accustomed
to look upon it as a sort of portion of their income but the Chief Secretary
said he would allow no compensation for what ought never to have been
allowed. Duncan & I then shook hands & separated.
May 1 Wednesday 1872
This morning was up in good time & went steadily to work in the office till I
was startled by a letter or rather Memo, from the Penal Office, telling me not to
flog a man until as I read it 4 May. I did?ent happen to know there was a man
to be flogged to-day so the memo, came very opportunely. I looked up the
Warrant & found the prisoner was sentenced to be flogged on the first of May
so I argued he could?ent be flogged on any other day & thought it best to go &
see Duncan on the subject. I took a cab & went to the office where I found or
had explained that instead of 4 May it was 4 o?clock. There was a party had given
notice they were trying to get the whipping commuted & so Duncan did?ent
want the flogging to take place until they would have a chance of getting an
answer & so named four o?clock. I went to Kerferd & spoke to him about
myself. He promised to keep the matter in view & to speak to others on the
subject. 1 then went to the Chief Medical Officer?s office & told him about the
flogging. Got the Pay this afternoon & took another cab to get the money. Got
it all right & as I had?ent a bag stuffed one hundred & ninety, one pound notes
in my coat tail pocket. When I had paid the cabman & was bustling away
almost at a run towards the Gaol some one shouted out to me in a very energetic
manner & on turning round I found to my consternation I was dropping notes
pretty closely as I proceeded. Of course I picked them all up & started again but
there was another shout & I found my pocket was still raining the precious
papers. I felt a little stupid more particularly when the cab-man I had been with
presented me with several notes he had found in the cab. The man who had
hailed me seemed pretty well to do, he however would have me shout & I gave
him a shilling which he accepted but would insist also on shaking my hand &
my friend evidently considered he had done something wonderfully honest & I
207 Evidently a reference to possibly scurrilous allegations that Castieau had used the prison
kitchen scraps to raise his own poultry and pigs.


am sure his conscience will gratify him exceedingly. When I had found that my
money was all correct, which I did by counting it in the Sheriff?s office, I
returned & gave the cab-man five shillings as he might easily have stuck to the
notes that I had lost in the cab. Memo, in future if I have no bag to remember
to stick notes in my breeches & not my coat tail pockets.
May 4 Saturday 1872
To night I received an answer to my Application for Promotion. It was a
guarded one but still unfavorable. Mr Duffy minuted the papers to this
effect, ?When effectual measures have been taken to render the Gaols self
supporting I will consider this application favorably, not before?. 208 This is a
blow to my hopes for I really cannot see what can be done more than is being
done in the Gaol at present. Perhaps in my letter I ought to have laid more
stress upon the work & responsibility unconvicted prisoners impose upon me
for after all, though the Public & the Press conveniently ignore this Class, yet
the keeping them safe & in good discipline without interfering with the legal
privileges they possess is Duty of an important character & in Melbourne is
pretty well work enough, what with the City & the Suburban Courts every
day & the Supreme Court once a month.
Joe White sent me a letter saying a gentleman to whom he had written &
who he believed had some influence with Mr Duffy had written to him on my
behalf. I am very much obliged to Joe but am sorry his friend has been too late.
I did not expect an answer so soon but suppose the Chief Secretary has been
spoken to about me & got the application out of the way as quickly as he could.
In to-day?s Age there appeared a very unfair article on the Castlemaine Gaol. It
was headed ?A Model Prison? & gave great praise to Hyland at the expense of
the other Gaol officers. Hyland has done no more than I did many years ago
at Beechworth, but from the Article which evidently has been compiled from
information supplied by himself it would appear that Hyland & Hyland only
was managing a prison properly in the Colony.
May 8 Wednesday 1872
Busy in the office during the morning. In the afternoon mustered & then went
to the Club. Walked home with Dr Maloney. In the Evening went again to the
Club, found no one there but Marcus Clarke & Shillinglaw. Had a chat with
them. Marcus read a portion of a comic Opera he was writing to be called ?The
Jolly Beggars?. It was very funny but I should think better adapted for the pages
of Punch than for the Stage. Shillinglaw was bemoaning his hard fate at not
being able to get any number of fellows to rush in with their �25 & enable him
to start off to Queensland & take up a mile of Country which he says
208 Castieau engaged in a lengthy correspondence with the Chief Secretary over this rejection

I.G.P.E. Volumes 14 and 15, Item(s) 2138, 2278, 2395, 3332, 3378, 3598.


Mr Ulrich the Geologist pronounces to be rich in tin. Eville came in to the
Club & I left: with him. He had an order to see Mr Leslie, an Electro-biologist
who was holding a seance at the lower St George?s Hall. I went with Eville &
saw the usual biological entertainment, boys being made to forget their names,
nurse imaginary babies & otherwise make fools of themselves. There did not
however appear to be any originality about the affair & so I came away. Eville
wanted a beer so we went up stairs to the Cafe of the Theatre Royal (that used
to be). Oh it was so melancholy looking, the Gasoliers with the exception of
one over the bar were not lighted & the room was consequently almost in
darkness. Coppin & two friends were sitting at a table & this was all the
Company in a room that used to be one of the most frequented in Melbourne.
We had one drink & came away at once. Got home by about half past nine &
had some grog & a smoke or two. Polly went off to bed but f dozed for some
time in the chair before I went upstairs myself.
May 13 Monday 1872
This morning in the office as usual though very careful of my thumb which
I exercised as little as possible. Am not aware of anything particularly worth
remarking this day. Mustered in the afternoon. After Muster went to the
Club & walked home with Jardine Smith. In the evening did not go out as I
had a man under Sentence of Death who was to be executed to-morrow.
After nine o?clock I went over to see this man who was Edward Feeney
charged & convicted of having murdered Charles Marks in (see 6 March). 209
Feeney was particularly quiet & when I spoke to him said he was quite
prepared to meet his fate. He however wished he said to make a statement &
that was to deny the allegation that he had been told had been published of
his having been improperly intimate with the murdered man Marks. This he
solemnly declared to be untrue & as a dying man declared there was not the
slightest grounds for the rumour. Feeney wished me to make this statement
of his public & I agreed to do so. Did not go out this evening but was
interviewed by a Reporter of The Argus to whom I told my tale. He of course
was delighted to get it as it was something approaching the Sensational. Julia
still continues in the sulks & has made Mrs Castieau very cross. Julia?s
conduct is inexcusable but when I proposed speaking to her to-night Polly
would not let me but insisted on her being let alone till to-morrow. Polly &
I had a difficulty & then we went to bed.
May 14 Tuesday 1872
Got up this morning feeling very unrefreshed having taken more gin &
water last night than was good for my complaint. Put on my black clothes
& went into the Gaol to see things were in readiness for the execution of
Edward Feeney. At ten o?clock the usual business was transacted. The
209 Castieau's notation.


Sheriff & I went to the Cell & Feeney came out. Old Bamford was ready
to pinion him & did so a little more clumsily than usual. In putting the cap
on Feeney?s head he had a little difficulty getting it over the hair. At such a
time a second seems like a minute & a minute almost an hour. Feeney
prayed to the last. He was evidently in a great state of fear & shook a good
deal. This I could see being close to him. The bystanders some little
distance off thought he showed little signs of concern. Bamford did the
pulling tight the rope a little too hard & when the bolt was drawn the body
scarcely fell fairly, the rump catching the side of the scaffold & thus
breaking the fall. Feeney seemed to struggle much longer than men who are
hanged usually do. Dr Barker however styled the horrible spasmodic
movement as simply ?reflex? & of no consequence. He could not however
answer my question as to why some when executed were troubled with
reflex movements & others were not. There was a Post-Mortem held after
the usual Inquest & the Medical Students under direction of Dr Barker
revelled in the luxury of a fresh & healthy corpse. Oh poor humanity how
small you look on the dissecting table. There had been some strange stories
told of the connection that existed between Feeney & the murdered man.
Barker exposed Feeney?s rectum & both he & Dr Youl said it told of a
vicious indulgence. I was asked my opinion, or rather to coincide in theirs,
but I declined as I had no experience of what a healthy rectum would
represent. Doubleday took a cast of Feeney?s head. 210
May 22 Wednesday 1872
Mustered in the afternoon & afterwards went to the Club. There I read
The Herald until it was time to go home to tea. In the evening came into
Town again & on the Road to the Club met Marcus Clarke who asked me to
walk to-wards the House with him. There was a great debate going on & a
want of confidence motion on the grounds that the patronage of the Ministry
had been unfairly distributed. Some bitter things had been said of Duffy &
as he was to reply to-night there were Great Expectations of something spicy
& consequently a run upon the Speakers Gallery. I walked as far as the House
with Clarke, but found it was no use trying to get in & so left him to take
his place in the Reporters Gallery where his Press connection gives him the
entree. Went back to the Club & after a chat with Mr Wyatt left with
Duerdin & Eville. In Bourke Street we met Levey 211 &at his invitation went into
the White Hart & had a glass. Levey was talking of himself & of the chances of
the Ministry. He declared he did not wish a Dissolution just now, as he meant to

at the Old Melbourne Gaol.

the Melbourne Herald, he held the parliamentary seat of Normanby from 1861 to 1867, but

get into Parliament at the next election if he could & he was hardly prepared at
present for action. Levey made us laugh by gravely stating that Winter was a bad
time for an election so far as the candidates were concerned as it made the
expenses so much heavier. We asked how that could be & were informed by the
ex-member that in cold weather committee-men & supporters would sit round
the fire & enjoy social glass after social glass till all hours, of course at the
Candidate?s expense, while in Summer people did?ent care to be indoors &
therefore did?ent so systematically sot away & consequently the Hotel Bills were
not nearly so heavy. Said Levey, ?I have had experience & I can tell you without
joking that the difference is something considerable?. Walked again down Bourke
Street & then came away home.
May 25 Saturday 1872
Up this morning in good time & feeling tolerably well. Went into the office &
remained there nearly the whole of the morning. After dinner as Polly felt sleepy
& I was tired, we went and had a nap. Mustered in the afternoon. After Muster
was busy for some time & just as I was leaving the office the Post brought a letter
from the Penal Office which made me savage & let out an expression that was
much nearer an oath than was proper for me to make. Polly had come in to see
what I was doing as it was getting late & she just entered the office door as my
temper got the better of me & with a stamp of the foot I let of[fj the steam that
would otherwise have burst my mental boiler. Polly quickly retired & 1 sat
down as is my wont to answer right off the episde which had disturbed my
equilibrium. There was nothing particular in the letter I got but it was one of a
series of nagging, irritating authority assuming ones that I receive from the Penal
Office written & signed by Snelling for the Inspector General. This one was
with reference to some labor Returns which I had altered to please the Office &
which were now sent back again because Mr Snelling evidently was not
acquainted with what Mr Duncan had previously written. I wrote a hot &
strong memo, but alas it was of no more use than the letters Mr Pommy Traddles
used to indite to the Duke of Wellington 212 for after I had written it I saw it
would be unwise to send it & so scored through the severest & the most
intended home thrusts in it & then not satisfied began to write again getting
more milk & watery every time. At last I gummed a piece of paper over the
original memo. I had written & wrote on it something more quiet. Polly for an
hour was bothering me to go out with her & the youngsters according to my
promise & at length went away in a huff without me. Better spirit however got
the advantage & I followed her quick. We went into Bourke Street, through the
Arcade & the Market, then returned & on our way home bought some lollies
at Mr Notts. After a smoke & some toddy went away to bed.
212 Tommy Traddles, David Copperfield's schoolfriend who was always getting caned and
always going to write to his uncle about it, but never did'. Castieau appears to imagine the
reference to the Duke of Wellington, who is not mentioned in the novel.


May 27 Monday 1872
Up early this morning in time to see the prisoners away to the Swamp.
Thought much better of my Memo. & cut it down into something civil
before sending it away. Was very busy all the morning & amongst other
things wrote a letter to Nathan offering to give him �lO3 for �lOO for three
months & to be allowed to renew at the same rate if I required to do so.
Mustered in the afternoon & then went down to the Club. In the evening
went to the Opera with Miss Thorpe & Miss Marchment & Mr Moore. Polly
of course went also. The Opera was Lucretia Borgia & I enjoyed it tolerably
well though I had rather a bad seat as there was a spooning couple sitting just
before me who were unfortunately big people & who were constantly putting
their heads close together & thereby obstructing my view of the Stage.
Signora Bosisio the Prima Donna is very nice looking & a good actress as
well. I was however very much irritated when in the height of some very
thrilling parts of the drama & when overwhelmed with passion or despair she
so far forgot herself as to respond to the applause of some nincompoops in
the Audience by bowing low & sweetly smiling. It is hard to take up the
tragic again exactly where it was left off. This absurd notice of the Audience
was particularly observable in the great scene between Lucrezia & Alfonso
where the Duke insists on the mother pouring out the poisoned wine
intended to deprive her son of life. Bosisio & Dondi really acted wonderfully
well & spite the absurdity of committing murder musically, yet I was really
feeling the dramatic power of the scene when the chord was snapped abruptly
by the bowing & scraping of both actor & actress to the audience. Our
friends came home & had a little supper with us.
June 13 Thursday 1872
Mustered in the afternoon. Afterwards went to the Club where I met Jardine
Smith. We walked home together. Smith expressed the opinion that
Government officers should have no votes & I agree with him. It would give
me much satisfaction to lose my own vote if the turnkeys were deprived of
theirs. Just now the turnkeys are very important individuals in their own
estimation. They are likely to have a voice in the election of a Minister of the
Crown & are being looked after as of some consequence, there being between
25 & 30 votes connected with the Gaol.
June 23 Sunday 1872
Up this morning in good time. Sissy was not very well as her tooth was
bothering her. She did?ent go to Church. Godfrey had a boil at the back of
his neck & so he was?ent able to go either. Mamma & I took the rest with
the exception of baby. Mr Torrence preached the best sermon we have had
from him yet. It was on the text ?First pluck out the beam that is in thine own
eye? &c. We all of us had some hard hits. Telo came to dinner as he agreed &


stayed with us the whole of the afternoon. He seems to take to the children
& the children make a great plaything of him. In the afternoon I took Telo
into the Gaol Hospital where there was lying dead the body of a man named
Johnstone who died of Consumption last night. There was also in a terrible
fit of Delirium Tremens a surveyor named Raven. While I was talking to him
he asked for a pen & when the attendant said he had?ent one, Raven said
look, look you idiot, there?s a double row of them all up your waistcoat. At
one time he fancied there were fish in his mouth & snapped his jaws at them
biting his tongue very severely. It will be a wonder if he pulls through for
certainly his is one of the worst of many bad cases we have had this year. Telo
thinks he can make a pot boiler out of the intercepted letters written to or by
prisoners, so I gave them to him as I do not believe it can do any harm & he
has promised to let me see the slips before they are published , 213 We had a
regular chat in the evening. Telo told the children an adventure of his with
the Bushranger Morgan & a Bush Ghost story. Before Telo went away he had
promised to take the youngsters to School and the Japs on Tuesday evening
next. School is the name of a Piece now playing at St George?s Hall & ?Japs?
is short for Japanese, a number of whom give a tumbling & juggling
entertainment after the Drama. Went into town with Telo & called at the
Club. Had a chat with Gilbee, McKinley & Amsinck, then came away & got
home in good time. Polly expressed herself much pleased with Telo & looks
forward to his taking her to the theatre as well as the children. The Elections
are exciting great religious feeling. The Orange men are rolling up & unless
much care is taken, there will be some broken heads if not worse before the
state of the Poll at West Melbourne or some other places is made known. 214
June 24 Monday 1872
Up this morning impressed with the idea that there were a great many things
to be done & that it was hard to tell which it was best to do first. Got into a
little temper about a delay that occurred in sending some men to the Penal
Office. I do not think Senior Turnkey Quin relished at all the way I spoke.
The Argus of this morning contained a manifesto from Alipius, Roman
Catholic bishop of Melbourne, 215 calling upon good churchmen to vote against
the return of the present Ministers & endeavouring to inflame the blood of
ignorant catholics by declaring that the system of secular instruction about to
be introduced by the Ministry would be the means of enslaving the catholic
people & depriving them of their religious rights. The manifesto was too hot
& in consequence it disgusted a great many who would otherwise have been
opposed to the Ministry. It was said at the Club last night that it would be as
213 Subsequently published in The Leader (see Diary, 5 July 1872).
214 The 1872 election was fought especially on the secular education issue and was the occasion
of much sectarian dispute.
215 Bishop (from 1874 Archbishop) James Alipius Goold (1812-1886).


good as 200 votes to Langton. 216 The Herald which is the Duffy organ, saw the
evil that had been done & attributed the bishop?s pastoral to the influence of
O?Shannassy, the well known enemy of Duffy. This is however far fetched.
June 26 Wednesday 1872
This was the day of the great contest between the recently appointed Ministers
& the nominees of the Duffy faction. I was up at half past six o?clock & in the
Gaol. Made arrangements for the turnkeys to have the opportunity of voting
& at the same time warned them against being in any way demonstrative or
loitering about the polling booths. Quin rather impertinently remarked that
the turnkeys had never been guilty of such conduct & I got out of temper &
told him I was giving the turnkeys good advice & that as he had opened his
mouth he could take it to himself if he thought proper. Quin I thought would
sulk but I am glad to say he had the good sense to apologise for the mistake he
had made. I polled my own votes early & did not go out of the Gaol again until
after the election was over. In the afternoon I mustered & then I went down
town. The excitement was great. Polly went off to Elsternwick to Cowderoys
by the half past five o?clock train. I saw Polly off. Darvall went down with us
& went to Elsternwick later in the evening. Harry was with me & I gave him
3d to spend instead of sending [him] home by the omnibus as his mamma had
promised he should be.
Went to the Club. Just as I was going in I met McKinley very excited & he
asked me to go along with him & a Mr Britton to the Age office where the
Returns of the State of the Polls was expected to first arrive. Went there & at the
door ran close up to Duncan who was also on the look out. He said he could?ent
go out of town without knowing the result & I said I was going out of town but
not until I knew it was quiet. Went back to the Club & drank any amount of
brandy & water with a lot of excited press men & others. The Ministers were all
returned by large majorities & Finn at St Kilda lost his �3O deposit money. At
nine o?clock left the Club with Duerdin who walked with me to the Railway
Station where we had a drink together. I started for Elsternwick & got to
Cowderoys where we played bagatelle & looked at Photographs till eleven o?clock
when we left to catch the last train to Melbourne. Got home all right, smoked a
pipe & was as screwed as screwed could be.
July 2 Tuesday 1872
Through the Gaol early this morning but it was a nasty damp day & I felt
that very little except office work would be done in consequence. Ranking,
one of the Turnkeys annoyed me very much. He had been away on Sunday
& Monday & coolly asked again for Leave to-day. In declining his request I
got very much out of temper & thought after a little sulking my model
216 Edward Langton (1828?1905), politician. In 1872 he was Treasurer and Postmaster-General
in the Francis ministry ( Australian Dictionary of Biography).


turnkey would attend to his duty without more to-do. However this was not
the case & about two hours after I received a note from the Penal Office very
civilly worded but asking me to give Ranking two hours Leave if he could be
spared. The turnkey had sent his wife. I bullied him tolerably considerably &
wrote a pretty short memo, referring to his conduct. Mr Duncan was up in
the afternoon & I brought Ranking before him & he was told how
improperly he had acted in referring to the office without my knowledge.
Owing to the Inspector General occupying my time I did not muster. After
he left I went to the Club & brought Jardine Smith home with me. He would
only stop however for a glass of wine. To-night we had a grand Juvenile Party;
about twenty children including our own. There was great fun, no end of
dancing & romping, Eating & drinking, Kissing & Squalling. Joe, Emma &
Agnes kindly gave their valuable services towards the entertainment of the
youngsters & Katey Morphy came over later in the evening. When our
friends had gone I made an incautious remark reflecting upon Polly's want of
management in not having a plate of sandwiches for the 'big ones'. This
brought a storm upon my head & Polly's sailing away in a stiff breeze. I
stopped till I had finished my cigar & then as Polly had put the gas out up
stairs in a pet, 1 went to sleep on the sofa in the Dining Room. The town was
startled from its propriety this morning by the loud voices of the News Boys
crying lustily Argus Extraordinary , 2nd Edition, full account of the Telegram
'Nous etions la, lisant les telegrammes a sensation, quand vint a passer un groupe d'aborigines:
quel contrast! (We were there, reading the sensational telegrams, when suddenly a group
of Aboriginal people came past: what a contrast!)' c.1866
Reproduced from Voyage autour du monde by the Marquis de Beauvoir (Paris, Plon, 1878)


from England. This was the first direct communication with the Old World
& the Extraordinarys were bought up with rapidity. 217 As Coldstream would
have said there?s nothing in it. 218 The Prices of Stocks, a slight fall in work,
though prices were steady & that is about all. The Telegram rushed across the
desert unspanned by the wire, with a horse express of great expense brought
from the Old to the New World.
July 5 Friday 1872
Mustered, after Muster went to the Club. There I met Snee & others. We had
a laugh & a little arguing. Walstab in his way is a little ?Wyatty?. 219 He is
generally in opposition & is not to be smoothed down by the submission of
the opponents for as soon as they concur with his views, he takes another
sight of the Case & proceeds on another tack which quite knocks on the head
even the arguments five minutes previously obtrusively urged by himself.
Telo gave me The Leader with the Prison letters article. There was?ent much
in it excepting the two guineas it gave the Author an opportunity of earning.
There was however I was glad to observe little that could be construed into a
breach of Regulations in allowing it to be published. Walked home with
Jardine Smith. In the evening Nurse went to the theatre. She had been away
all day at Brighton & had taken nurse [baby?] with her. Polly & I played
Bezique then took our toddy & went to bed. We slept the sleep of the
exhausted if not of the righteous until I heard the baby singing out, then I
nudged Polly & she with a sigh which would have vented itself in an oath if
uttered by a male, she rose acknowledging maternal instincts to be stronger
than even love of repose. The boy came or was brought to our bed but he
would?ent sleep. He wanted nurse & nurse he would find. He was certain she
was gone in a cab & if mamma would only open the door she could get in.
Polly had to wait till nurse returned which was not however very late. I was
I think asleep when Polly got back to the sheets. If so however she awoke me
with the weight of her descent. Never mind, we soon got off to sleep again
& so far as I was concerned I dreamt this night enough to last a reasonable
being for at least a twelve month. The Solicitor General & a big fire were
caught up together in the most bewildering fashion & beyond that I cannot
remember the why & the wherefore. I had to run to avoid getting scalded
from a boiler likely to burst.

July 9 Tuesday 1872
In the Office & remained there during the morning. Darvall came to say
good bye & I walked with him to meet the Omnibus. Received a Telegram
from Edwin Smith calling upon me to write or send a Telegram. I had sent a
letter before the telegram arrived. Mustered & then went down to the Club.
There was no one there I cared much for but Wyatt asked me to speak to
Kerferd about him if I had the chance as he was applying for the County
Court Judgeship vacant by the leave allowed to Judge Cope. I said I should
be very glad to do so if I got the chance & really think the Government could
not make a better appointment for it would surely be approved by the Press
& could not well be questioned by the Public. Polly wanted to go to the
Opera to-night & so did Miss Thorpe. They had?ent a beau & so I was called
upon to accompany them as a protector.
We got to the Theatre some time before it was necessary as I found out my
Watch was ten minutes fast. This necessitated our walking about for ten
minutes or so before we could get in to take our places. There was not much
excitement & consequently no crowd. We therefore had the opportunity of
taking our choice of most of the seats & therefore settled ourselves very
comfortably in the front row. Mr Tetley & a Mrs Lipscomb came in afterwards
we managed to get them places alongside of our own. The opera was
Traviata. Signora Bossisio took the leading part & played it very effectively.
Beyond her there was not however very much attraction. There was a lot of
time wasted between the Acts & the waiting was somewhat wearisome.
Notwithstanding all this however I enjoyed the music & came home tolerably
contented with the Evenings entertainment. After landing Miss Thorpe safely
at her abode Polly & I went home & to bed as soon as she had finished her
supper & I my smoke. Sent away to-day a lot of larrikins to Castlemaine. I had
trusted to Rowley to select none but able bodied prisoners & was surprised to-
day to find how many young fellows there were among the number. They were
however all well able to work & I do not think Hyland will have much cause
to grumble if he never gets any worse class of men to look after. I should like
him to see some that I have left on hand if he feels inclined to be dissatisfied.
July 10 Wednesday 1872
Rather sore this morning. The hard seat at the theatre I suppose. How
delicate I must be getting. After I had done pressing office work I took a cab
& went to the Penal office. Mr Duncan was not in so my labor & cab here
were lost. Chatted for a little time with Stone & transacted a little formal
business with Snelling then bent my way homewards doing the Block
however on the way. It was the business part of the day & Collins Street then
has a very different appearance to what it bears for an hour or two after the
principal offices are closed for the afternoon. Now instead of gay ladies &
amourous bachelors were everywhere to be seen men bustling or plodding


at business, mostly with anxious faces & a ?not to be done? look as if
everyone was mistrusting his contemporary. Got home before lunch time,
had rather a scraggy leg of mutton for dinner. I managed my share however
having got hungry under the influence of bitters. Polly was out of sorts &
longed for something more toothsome.
July 15 Monday 1872
This morning as soon as I came into the office I wrote a private note to Mr
Duncan with regard to the prison servants, trying very hard to induce him
to alter the rule he had laid down & allow the female officers to have their
washing done for them.
The Criminal Sittings commenced this morning & of course I went to the
Court. The Chief Justice presided. Came back to the Gaol as there was
plenty of work to be done. Had a chat with Dr Cairns respecting a young
man who is going home by the Mail & who is now in my charge. I am to
take him on board the Boat on Wednesday. In the afternoon I was at the
Court for a time, then mustered. After Muster went to the Club, saw
McKinley & had a chaffing match with Bright & Duerdin. Came away in
time for tea, had what Polly calls a ?Potato pot? a kind of Irish Stew & eat
very freely of it, in fact I am afraid I eat too much for I felt very lazy &
worthless. After the meal was finished, heard Harry & Sissy read. Then
played a couple of games of Bezique with Polly; she won the first & I the
second game. Polly has lectured me for the last two or three days on account
of my having had too much of my hair cut off & allowed the barber to clip
my whiskers & moustache. She considers the hair on my face sacred to her
own scissors & will allow no one else to interfere with it if she can help it.
Last week I went to get my hair cut & like a lamb allowed the operator to
cut away as he thought proper. Polly was disgusted & made me feel mean
when I came home, & many times since.
Had some toddy when Bezique was over & after the toddy & a smoke was
quite inclined for bed. Polly was in deshabille, having had her hair washed.
She came into the room with it all hanging over her shoulders & looked like
a ?mermiad? with a good sensible pair of understandings instead of a tail.
Got to bed but tossed about a good deal before going to sleep. Irish Stew,
Potato Pot or whatever else you choose to call, the dish we had for tea must
get the credit of this wakefulness on our parts.
Things appear very quiet just now & the reverse of sensational. I suppose
some astonishing incident will soon take place. If it does not we shall be very
dissatisfied. There must be something to raise the blood to boiling heat at least
once a week or else Victorians begin to grumble & to bemoan the quietness &
dullness of all about or connected with the Colony. There?s nothing in the
Newspapers & nothing anywhere. Nothing to eat, nothing to drink, nothing
to read, nothing to do.


July 24 Wednesday 1872
Today as usual employed at ordinary work. Went to the Sheriff?s office & saw
Walford. He is determined to get his Promotion if worrying about it will
ensure it. He has tackled Mr Crews now and looks forward to his Case being
brought forward in the House by that gentleman. I told Walford that unless
the Government consented to make no opposition, there would be little
chance of any but the usual Reply, that the Government would consider the
subject as soon as they had time. Walford however considers his case to be an
exceptional one. Was about the gaol the whole day but did not muster. Mrs
Manders was very anxious to go to the Inspector General and tell him of her
grievances. I let her go. She was not however able to see him as he had not put
in an appearance at his office. I wrote a Memo, on an application put in by
Mrs Nixon and Mrs Henry for servants to be allowed them. I recommended
strongly that the old system of allotting three female servants for the Washing
of the female officers should be returned to, but at the same time I urged that
whatever the result of the application the officers must be informed that they
cannot be allowed to keep on grumbling & must during hours of Duty think
more of the Establishment and less of themselves. Polly was away as usual. She
came home at some time or other in the evening & said she had been to Mrs
Kilpatrick?s at Elsternwick. She is looking over my shoulder now so I had
better not express further my real opinions as to her going on. She might be
worse but certainly could be a great deal better. Went to the Club & after a
loud talk left with Duerdin & Jardine Smith. Polly was in time for tea in the
evening. Harry & I read for a long time together. Harry is beginning to
understand what he reads & takes a fair part in Dialogue Reading. After Harry
had gone to bed I went on Duty & played a Regulation Game of Bezique with
the Missus. Polly went off to bed & soon screamed for me to follow. I did
without delay as I was afraid of the consequences if I at all showed a proud
spirit. The Somersetshire arrived to-day & brought later English News,
nothing however very startling. Tichbourne Case is again talked about, the
Claimant is Starring it throughout the English Provinces. He made his last
entry into Bristol where he appears to have been feted & made a great deal of.
He should visit America; properly ?Barnumised? 220 he would make a fortune
out of the Yankees & would make with his 26 stone weight & the Romance
of his position a better show than Tom Thumb, or Washington?s nurse.
July 27 Saturday 1872
Got up this morning & remained up as soon as the bell rang at half past six
o?clock this morning. It was very damp & cold but although there was a little
rain at first it was not much to signify. Went through the Gaol & saw what
was going on. After breakfast, commenced office work. Received a letter from
220 Refers to the publicity teqhnique employed by P.T. Barnum and the Barnum and Bailey Circus.


Mrs Smith telling of her daughter in Law?s intended departure from England
& asking my services on her account. Later in the day I also received one
from my father which had been enclosed in one to Joe to save postage I
suppose. Received a number of English papers from Edwin Smith?s relatives.
Forwarded him some letters I had received for him. Mustered in the
afternoon & after Muster was over, went to the Club. Had a look at Punch
& Vanity Fair & then left. In the road home I met Duerdin who advised me
strongly to have nothing whatever to do with the Claims at Alexandra which
I had been asked to speculate in. He knew the promoters & did not believe
in them. I was not much tempted ever to have done so particularly as I have
no money. However I certainly shall positively decline all connexion with
them now I have had such advice. Polly & I each made a very hearty tea of
lobster. Polly was commenting upon the dearness of the shops. The lobster
we had to-night was a fine one & very fresh & at the door cost only a shilling.
At a shop one of the same size & quality would be sold for two shillings.
The hawkers are certainly sometimes beneficial to housekeepers. For dinner
yesterday, Polly had to pay at a shop 3/6 for a little fish the like of which
is often brought to the house for 1/6. Now meat is getting dear again
housekeepers moralise over these apparent trifles. Harry this evening
commenced reading McAuley?s History of England. 12 ' He is getting a great deal
too fond of Plays & funny pieces & as he reads for marks I mean for the future
to make him earn them with literature more solid & substantial. Polly amused
herself this evening with the Family Herald & I read The Australasian until it
was time to go to bed. We got to sleep between eleven & twelve o?clock, but
when I was off & away, ding, dong went the bell, & with a nudge from Polly
I was out of bed, into my trousers & ready to answer it. Detective Brown was
at the Gate with a prisoner he had just brought in from Sandhurst. I took him
in & went to bed again, but it was a very long time before I could get to sleep
again. I had been thoroughly awakened & sleep had deserted me; when I did
sleep, I had nightmare & dreams of a decidedly unpleasant nature.
July 28 Sunday 1872
Sunday morning. Expected the Dean to preach in the Gaol. He did not
however come. I had intended to hear him but did not go into the Gaol when
I heard from Mr Studdert that the visit of the Very venerable? was postponed.
Polly was rather cross at my thinking of attending prayers in the Gaol instead
of going with her & the family to St John?s. I was very unwell & got out of
temper very quickly. In a fit of sulkiness I would?ent go to Church at all. The
boys were full of life & mischief. In my nervous condition they played the
deuce with my head & I was very thankful when they all cleared away & went
with mamma to Church. After a quiet read for an hour or so I felt much more
221 The History of England by Thomas Babington Macauley (1800-1859) ran to many editions.


amiable & undertook to take baby out for a walk. The little fellow was very
chatty & agreeable & we went for a good long stroll. All went merry as a
marriage bell, till in a thickly populated thoroughfare, the youngster startled
me by saying he wanted to P. I got him in as quiet a neighbourhood as possible
& tried to help him get ready. I could?ent manage, however, so I told him he
must wait till he got home. We walked on for another five minutes when Ernest
most emphatically remarked, ?I will P, now,? & P, he did. I trust no evil results
in the shape of cold will follow, but I record this little incident as it left on my
mind a strong impression of the helplessness of a man when left alone by
himself with a little child. With a woman, Ernest?s difficulty would have been
got over in an instant. With me there was only one thing that I rejoiced at &
that was It was only to P he wanted. Met Polly & the children as they came out
of Church. The Bishop had preached to them & they were late in consequence.
It was past one o?clock when they left the Church.
Got bad-tempered & disagreeable at dinner. Stayed at home all the
afternoon & in the evening went to the Club, read for a time & then came
home. Smoked in solemn silence, building all the while castles in the air of
prodigious strength & importance, Castles that if substantial structures would
make me wealthy & the envied of the enviable, they dissolved quickly when
for a moment my thoughts turned to the Bills I have to pay next month. Went
to bed. Before I went to sleep I grumbled a half apology to Polly for my bad
temper to-day, then turned & tried to force myself to sleep. Must honestly say
I did?ent find it much trouble so to do.
July 29 Monday 1872
Usual employment in the Gaol. It was however a very slack day for a Monday &
fewer prisoners received than usual. I was much amused by one prisoner?s letter
that in the course of Duty I read to-day. The prisoner is in Gaol for beating his
wife & excused himself in this fashion. ?I came home not in the best of tempers
not having made much money during the day & when I went in to the house
my daughter was scrubbing the floor. She told me I ought to have gone in
through the back door & not dirtied her floor. I said it was like her impudence
& then she called her mother who took her part. Now I had had a drop of drink
& though I know it was wrong, I must admit I did slap her face, but there I assure
you, the slap she got would not have raised a blush upon her cheek.?
Mustered in the afternoon & after Muster went to the Club. Walked home
with Jardine Smith. In Swanston Street, the Missus & some of the youngsters
picked me up & went home with us. In the evening I read to the youngsters
out of Peter Parley 222 & then heard Harry read a Page of Macauley. Went into
the office & looked over some of the pages of my last year?s Diary. Really it
222 Children's book or magazine by Peter Parley, the pseudonym of S.G. Goodrich, a Canadian
whose stories (e.g. his Short Stories for Long Nights, 1838) were immensely popular in the
Victorian era.


is wonderful how much one forgets; but for the Diaries I believe I should in
a year or two have no conception or recollections of heaps of things that were
when they took place considered of great importance & which even now
when remembered seem important still. Sent Edwin Smith his newspapers &
also wrote him a letter asking his intentions with regard to his wife when she
arrived in the Colony. I fear very much he has no intentions except to share
with her the money she brings with her. I put the matter to him very plainly
& think I must draw an answer from him. That it will be a satisfactory one
I can scarcely expect.
I am invited to attend a Meeting to-morrow afternoon called for the
purpose of initiating measures for the Establishment of an Aid Society for
prisoners on leaving Gaol. I shall go because I think a Society of the kind if
properly managed would be very useful & be the saving of some who would
not return to Gaol if there was some employment for them to go to upon
their discharge. I think also it would be well worthy the attention & support
of the Government. I am convinced both men & women frequently leave the
Gaol impressed with the folly of leading dissolute lives. They can-not
however battle with the world without assistance. Reputable people turn the
cold shoulder upon them & their applications for employment & at last in
desperation they seek the kind word & shelter where it is to be got, among
their old companions or those they have made in Gaol. Return to prison is
then certain & merely a time of days or weeks. Their having been in Gaol
before & the company they are keeping is sufficient to make them fair game
for the Police.
July 30 Tuesday 1872
In the Gaol as usual. Have not been at all well for some time & to-day felt
very queer. Transacted usual business & in the afternoon went to a meeting
called for the purpose of establishing a Society for the Aid of Discharged
prisoners. When I went into the room I saw the Dean, a number of
Clergymen of different denominations & Captain Standish. 223 The Captain
hailed me with apparent thankfulness. He said until I came he felt as [if] he
were the only sinner in the crowd & that he was entirely out of his element.
Judge Pohlman was in the chair & said in opening the meeting all that pretty
well was to be said in favor of the movement. Mr Grieg the Superintendent
of the Immigrant?s Home then read some Reports from America on Prisoners
Aid Societies & the good that had there been effected by them. After this the
Judge in a very kind & flattering manner called upon me to express my
sentiments. I got up & said what I thought which was that if properly
conducted a Discharged Prisoners Aid Society would be a great benefit.
Standish afterwards promised to do all he could to aid the Society. The Jewish
Clergymen spoke of the success of a little Society they had for helping
223 Frederick Charles Standish (1824-1883), Chief Commissioner of Police from 1858 to 1880.

discharged prisoners of their religion, then a Committee was formed of
which I was elected a member & the meeting broke up. I went to the Club
& then came home to tea. Polly went in the evening with Miss Marchmont
& Miss Thorpe to see The Huguenots} I '' I got my pipe & smoked away till it
was getting very late, then without waiting for Polly?s return I went to bed &
was asleep before she came. I received to-day two letters from Beechworth,
one from Alderdice asking for �1.12 he had paid Tom Cole for the
Abyssinian on my account & one from Bentley asking me to get a design for
a painted window for the Beechworth Burke Museum. 225
July 31 Wednesday 1872
It is a long time since I was so ill as I was today. From the time I got up till
the evening I was troubled with acidity on the stomach and was miserable in
consequence during the whole of the day. I plucked up enough to do my
work & mustered in the evening. After muster I went to the Club and had a
chat with Major Snee who is to have twelve months in England to study
Gunnery. I promised when he went home to give him a letter of introduction
to my father & he seemed very much pleased at the chance of meeting an old
Artillery Officer. Polly was not very well tonight and we both went to bed
early. The women today had a grievance about their hominy which they said
was served to them cold. I told them I would enquire about it & if there was
anything wrong endeavour to get it rectified. They are evidently a little
unsettled & anxious to make a little excitement for themselves. I spoke
tolerably plainly to them & let them understand if they did'ent like Gaol
Fare, they should stop away from prison. They drew very unfavorable
224 Meyerbeer?s opera, The Huguenots , perhaps attended with special interest, given the Castieau
family?s Huguenot background. Castieau and Polly had attended an earlier production in
1870 (Diary, 15 August 1870).
225 Castieau had been an important promoter of the Burke Museum. The decorative Burke Memorial
Window, with its emblem of the Southern Cross in gold stars, was manufactured in Melbourne
and installed at a cost of �3O in 1874. It remains a centrepiece of the museum in Beechworth.


comparisons between the Gaol & Pentridge & told them Pentridge I knew
was a very nice place & I wished with all my heart they were there. Polly &
her domestics had a great day teasing some hair for a mattress. They were all
sitting round a big heap of hair and most industriously picking it asunder &
making it fit for restuffing. The Argus had no report of the meeting yesterday
for the establishing of a Discharged Prisoners Aid Society. The Telegraph
however had a tolerably fair report & The Age came out with a sub leader in
which they expressed their gratification at seeing that Captain Standish, Mr
Sturt and myself were present. They said that our presence was a criterion the
Society would be formed on a practical basis. I think if properly gone about,
the Society will receive substantial recognition from the Public and be in a
position to do much good. I will have however to be careful & not excite the
jealousy of Mr Duncan by taking a too prominent part as he may think it his
right from the position he holds to be the foremost in the movement.
August 1 Thursday 1872
Better to-day but still rather shaky feeling weak & without energy. Wrote
letters to Alderdice & to Bentley. Was about the Gaol the whole of the day.
Mustered in the afternoon. As I finished Muster Mr Duncan put in an
appearance. He talked about the Gaol & about the Prisoners Aid Society. He
talked about the Quarters & is evidently bothered at the number of promises
& half-promises that have been given to one officer & another at different
times. He told me had recommended the closing up of Kilmore Gaol & the
officers who were doing Duty there being transferred from Kilmore to
Melbourne Gaol. This certainly is very sensible on his part but it is I fear too
practical for the Government to adopt, as the Kilmore people with John
O?Shannassy at their head will be sure to make a great fight to retain the
dungeon walls in their midst. It will test at any rate the probabilities of the
Penal Commission?s suggestions as to the doing away of the Country Gaols
being carried out. Mr Duncan asked me if I had heard any more about my
receiving any consideration. I said I had not, he said he thought Mr Francis
was favorable but did?ent like to go against the Estimates of the late Ministry.
He said he could?ent understand how it was that some of the things he
proposed had been agreed to & others not. I said, ?lt was strange?.
August 7 Wednesday 1872
In the evening I heard Harry read. He could not however get on very well &
so I turned him over to his mother & played first ?Beggar my Neighbour?
with Dotty. I bounced respecting my Play very much before we commenced
but the young lady beat me in a manner that made her quite satirical. Then
Harry like a young Elephant commenced with me a game of Bezique. He
spluttered the cards here & there, made sometimes a sensible keen remark
but lost the game in a highly flighty & over excited manner. The boy will not


be slow that?s certain; probably it would be better if he were. My quickness
has done me little service & brought me into many scrapes.
After Harry, methodical Sissy played Bezique with me. She plodded along
& in the end won ?Hands down? (this is not intended for a pun). Smoked
away for an hour or so, then as Polly had gone to bed went also. Was very
restless however & could not sleep well. What does it portend? Twice I have
dreamt long of a great funeral & once of seeing the shade of Mr Wintle. The
old gentleman did not look at me but was sitting in a chair leaning his head
upon his hand. Do Spirits sit & have they chairs?
August 15 Thursday 1872
The Criminal Sittings commenced this morning & I was at the Court by ten
o?clock to be in attendance upon the presiding Judge who this time was Mr
Justice Barry. There were no cases of importance; one miserable looking
deformed blear eyed youth pleaded Guilty to an Unnatural Offence. He was
caught in the act with a Goat. Mr Barry seized the opportunity & dealt out
an elaborate sentence. Ten Years on the Roads & to be three times whipped
by the Common Hangman, 25 lashes on the breech with a cat o nine tails.
For an attempt at a similar offence the Arab? 226 was sentenced to three years
cumulative. Now so far as the heinousness of the offence is concerned, 1 for
one would offer no defence, but was this wretched youthful specimen of
humanity who pleaded Guilty to-day aware of its heinousness, or did he do
it as something he thought if found out he would get ?larruped? for? 1
questioned him & found he was cunning, but beyond that almost a born
natural. He said his age was about 15 but he had whiskers on his face &
hands that looked like those of a deformed man. I should think he was from
18 to 20. He said his mother was dead & that his father had been a digger at
Chiltern, & was taken ill while working, which caused the boy to be taken
from him & removed to the Industrial School. He was at School (according
to his statement) at Chiltern, but notwithstanding his tuition there & his
further schooling at Sunbury he is now unable to read further than the
knowledge of the letters of the Alphabet. There was a book on my desk with
H.M. Gaol, Melbourne, marked on the back of it in capital letters. The boy
was asked to read it & said H correctly, then N for M, & after calling G, C
spelt G.A.0.1.. correctly. ?What does that spell?? was asked; the little blear
eyes emitted a faint sparkle & their professor replied exultingly ?Gold?. The
horrid part of this matter after all is the statement made by the prisoner when
arrested which was that he had learnt the crime he had committed from
seeing the boys at Sunbury commit themselves in the same way with the
Goats that were about the Station. The sentence of Judge Barry?s would have
been a righteous one if the culprit had been a man but with this idiotic infant
I think it lacketh discretion & will cause the judge tribulation.
226 Street urchin.


August 21 Wednesday 1872
Not a very exciting day. In fact I can scarcely tell how it passed away, yet it
did pass away & I was not idle either. There were no less than thirty-six male
prisoners discharged to-day. Fifteen of them were sent away to the Hulk. 227
They were particularly required to be able bodied & were passed by Dr
McCrea. They did not however I must say look a very lively lot. At Luncheon
or rather dinner time there was a loud knocking at the door which Polly
found came from Mrs Kerferd who had come to see us bringing all her little
ones. Of course it happened we were very unprovided having only cold meat.
However we made the best of it & pulled the children through with the help
of bread & butter. Polly went out with Mrs Kerferd in the afternoon but was
not over delighted with that lady?s style of buying the articles she wanted at
the drapers? shops & rather astonished at her only getting two tickets for
herself & family when she got to the Railway Station. She had Madeline,
almost a young woman, & four other children. Polly would have had four
whole tickets. Some people however know how to manage better than others.
Mustered in the afternoon & then went to the Club. Felt my position
unpleasantly while there, for I was called out of the room & told I was
wanted in the Strangers Room. I went & found Walstab the Novelist in
charge of a constable who had arrested him for non payment of his wife?s
maintenance. Walstab asked me to tell the Telegraph people of his trouble &
I did so, then hastened home so that I might be in time to receive the
prisoner when he arrived at the Gaol. Left the Club with McKinley & on the
way home met Mr Panton the Police Magistrate of Geelong & who was
formerly Visiting Justice at this Gaol. Walstab was soon in my custody & I
sent him to the Cell directing particularly that he should be supplied with
clean bedding. I thought it better to do no more than that for him. The
Visiting Justice was here to-day to try a prisoner for Assaulting another in the
Labor Yard. The prisoner was sentenced to a month with seven days in
Solitary Confinement & got off very cheaply as he had struck another with
a hammer. Had to-day a hunt for my tobacco & could not find it. Polly took
Harry to task & it appears the young scapegoat had taken & according to his
own account smoked it. I did not speak to him about it, leaving his mother
to manage the matter as she thought best. The little boys were in trouble to-
day again about their books. They cannot be brought to bring them home
227 The Sacramento at Williamstown. Prison hulks were used in Victoria from 1852 to 1859 to
cope with overcrowding in the gaols and prisons and as places of punishment for refractory
prisoners. In the 1860s they were used again to house female prisoners before their later
removal to Pentridge and then to Melbourne Gaol. The Sacramento was used in the 1870s
to accommodate well-behaved prisoners employed on public works at Williamstown. The
most famous hulk was the Success, which was resurrected as a floating convict museum
and toured the world from the 1880s; see James Semple Kerr, Out of Sight, Out of Mind
(Sydney, 1988), pp. 71-72 and Iris Petrass, ' "Those Who Trespass Against Us": Women in
Victorian Prisons', BA Hons thesis, Monash University, 1989, ch. 5.


regularly so to-night they were sent to bed & their sisters were well scolded
for not looking after their little brothers. A woman was murdered by a
drunken companion in some low den in the neighbourhood of Little Bourke
Street. A bottle of rum was the cause of Quarrel & an axe the instrument of
the murder.
August 27 Tuesday 1872
Not very happy to-day, had I fear a little fit of the Blues. Transacted ordinary
routine work in the Gaol & was upset by an answer I received from Mr
Duncan with regard to my protest against the Circular in which I was
directed to visit the Gaol at night & record my visits. I think the Circular was
an ill advised one yet I believe acting on impulse as I invariably do is about
the worst thing a man in my position can do if he studies his own interests.
Polly went away early as she was to go to Elsternwick to see the wedding of
Frank Stephens? daughters. It was a great affair, one girl was married to Mr
Travers a Squatter & rather aged, the other to Dr Madden a rising Barrister.
Sissy & Dotty with their cousins formed a little group in blue & I have no
doubt looked very nice. Mamma plumed herself at any rate upon having
heard Lady Canterbury call attention to them. I mustered in the afternoon
but did not go out before tea-time. Polly & Miss McDermott came. They
had left however the little girls behind as there was to be at Aunty Dotty?s a
doll wedding & a Party to celebrate it. We went to the Railway Station to
meet the children who arrived by the quarter to eight o?clock Train. It will be
Harry?s Birthday to-morrow & mamma wanted to buy him a Stamp Album
but did?ent wish him to see it till to-morrow. Much against Master Harry?s
will he was sent home by the omnibus with Dotty who was tired & then
Polly, Miss McDermott, Sissy & myself went into Bourke Street & bought
the Album.
The ladies went home & I looked in at the Club. Had a long chat with
Pickersgill, Amsinck, Levey & Duerdin. It was most amusing to hear
Pickersgill ?blow?. According to him fortunes are made & lost day after day
in Melbourne in manner most simple. He was full of a ?Spec? he had on hand
for the introducing into the Colony an English eleven to make a cricketing
tour of the Colonies. There was money to be made so ?Pick? affirmed. He
rather startled us by declaring that Spiers & Pond made �17,000 out of the
first English cricketers who visited the Colonies. It saved them Sir; they were
bankrupt till then. Their counting house was paved with writs & they had
not the slightest chance of getting over their difficulties till the advent of
Stephenson & his team. I got home at about ten o?clock. Miss McDermott
it was arranged should stay at our house to-night & did so. I smoked several
pipes, nursed my knee & dull care at the same time. Went however to bed
soon after Polly took her departure up stairs.


August 30 Friday 1872
Was in the Gaol at usual work to-day & employed myself during a portion of
the day at taking notes from an American Prison Report. Mustered in the
afternoon. Attended in the Women?s Wing in the morning & heard a number
of Cases. After Muster went to the Club & walked away from it with Duerdin.
In the evening played Bezique with the girls & afterwards a game with Polly.
Nathan came in the evening with a renewed Bill. I accepted it & paid him �5
Interest. I also paid him 12/ for a hat stand he had bought for us. I told
Nathan if he liked I would take �SO more from him. He said however ft
did?ent pay him at the price. I said ?all right? & sent him about his business.
Twenty per cent does?ent pay, & yet Nathan can take my Bill to the Bank &
get it discounted at eight per cent. I foretel a good deal of trouble for some
time with regard to money matters & cant tell how I shall be able to get along
this month as I shall not have a rap when I have paid my Insurance & the
portion of the loan now due. Ours certainly is an expensive house or rather
ours is a very little income. We certainly do have more grog in the place than
we should. This is however really the only extravagance. The children must be
taught & Music & such like accomplishments must be paid for.
There is to be a great lot of people at Seymour on Monday at the opening of
the Railway through to that place. Invitations to the extent of �SOO it is said has
been issued by the Government. We were not among the lucky ones invited.
August 31 Saturday 1872
Busy in the Office all the morning. Mr O?Loughlan the Crown Prosecutor
called to tell me he had represented to the Attorney General the advisability
of not flogging Angus Adams a young fellow convicted of a nasty offence at
the last Criminal Sittings. A Reporter from The Herald was here also. He was
he stated leaving The Herald & about joining The Express, a new Evening
Paper about to be started. He seemed bitter against The Herald & would?ent
ask for any news for it to-day. I showed him a book I was making notes from,
a Report on the American Gaols. He tried to make me promise I would work
my notes into an Article & give them to him for the new Paper. I did not
promise but he went away expressing himself in a way as if I had done so.
Mustered in the afternoon & after Muster went to the Club. Came away with
Duerdin. At the Eastern Market I bought a lobster & thought I had got it
very cheap as I only gave a shilling for it. When I got home, Polly I found,
had gone to meet me so I started Harry off to let her know I had reached the
house in her absence. When Polly returned she also produced a lobster. She
had been to the Eastern Market & for a shilling had also purchased a lobster.
We made merry over the coincidence & arranged to have one lobster for our
tea & the other children?s breakfast in the morning. Alas, when we had
commenced tea & Polly had tasted her share of the fish, she cocked her nose


in the slightest but still most suggestive manner & exclaimed ?ls this lobster
quite fresh?? There was no getting away from the fact, ?it was?ent quite?. Well,
so much for that lobster. Polly?s had been put on the side-board & before the
evening was over it sent forth the intelligence most palpably that it was?ent
quite fresh either. Then we compared notes & found that we had purchased
of the same man & that he had most emphatically represented the lobsters to
be in first rate condition. We came to the conclusion that perhaps a fish
monger?s lobster at 1/6 or even 2/- was preferable even on the score of
economy to a shilling one at the Eastern Market. Read The Australasian &
The Age. Then read a little to the youngsters & at ten o?clock went to bed.
About half past eleven Nurse called to us there was a fire. We were both very
sleepy but Polly must go to a fire if there is any chance of getting to it & so
we got up. There was a great blaze which we followed & found to proceed
from an Agricultural Instrument maker?s, the corner of Elizabeth Street &
Latrobe Street. The Fire seemed to be all up stairs, several shops below being
still open & apparently uninjured. The roof was iron & the whole of the
premises were sheltered by a wide iron verandah. There did?ent seem much
to burn yet the fire fought valiantly against an immense shower of water &
the houses were gutted before it was thoroughly conquered.
September 2 Monday 1872
Got to usual work & at usual time. Was tolerably busy all the morning &
occupied any liesure with taking notes from an American Gaol Report. There
was to be a Flogging administered this afternoon on a youth who I have
previously mentioned, Angus Adams. At first this morning I thought there
would be a bother about getting the flogging done as Old Jack had?ent put
in an appearance & Rowley did?ent know where to find him. I wrote a letter
to the Detective Police & had sent it away. The Messenger however returned
saying Bamford was coming. Jack then made his appearance & the difficulty
was surmounted, though I wanted to be prepared yet I did not think the
Flogging would be inflicted & so it proved. O?Loghlan as he had stated
applied to the Crown Law officers to get the sentence of flogging remitted &
they forwarded the letter to Dr McCrea declining to interfere & instructing
him to exercise as usual his discretion. When the doctor came, he in my
presence examined Adams & then certified ?he was not in a fit state of health
to be flogged at present?. I am very glad the punishment did not take place
as two or three of the Warders assure me Adams is not ?all right?. He walks
about without taking notice of any one or anything & is more like an animal
than a human being.
There was to be an Election at the Yorick to-day & I was asked particularly
to come down & vote, so I did & then returned to muster. After Muster I
went again to the Club & after a chat left with Duerdin & Jardine Smith. It
was Smith?s birthday & he came into our house & had a little brandy & water


before he went home. In the Evening I read a story from The Arabian Nights,
then played a game of Bezique with Dotty. This nearly spent the Evening, for
Polly & I went off to bed by ten o?clock.
To-day was the last day for registering votes & obtaining Electoral Rights.
I got mine this afternoon. The Registrar told me great efforts had been made
to get as many Catholic Votes registered as possible, in order no doubt that
should there be a great fight over the Education Question & a General
Election follow, that the Catholic Party may be in a position to show their
strength. I said to the Registrar, ?so I suppose you will keep open late to-night
as it is the last day for Registering?? ?I dont think so,? was his answer; ?but you
keep the shillings dont you?? said I. ?Well, not exactly, you see I get the
shillings & so much per annum if I register under 200 but if I register over
200 my salary is reduced by �5. Consequently if I keep open late & register
200 I should get 50/- more & lose �5. Now this wont pay.? I agreed.
September 3 Tuesday 1872
While I was in the office to-day I was astonished at hearing from Polly that
she had been to see Mr Francis 228 with regard to the question of my
promotion. Mr Francis received her very kindly & said he was not aware of
my having sent in any application. He promised he would personally enquire
into the matter. I hardly knew whether to be pleased or displeased with Polly?s
action but trust it has been for the best as I feel confident it was intended.
This Evening was rather a lazy one. I read & afterwards played a game of
Bezique with Polly, then went to bed. The Pay for August came to-night. Just
now there is a little excitement with regard to Port Darwin where new Gold
Fields are said to have been discovered. If the News is all corroborated there
will be an Exodus from the Mining Population of Victoria.
September 5 Thursday 1872
Mr Duncan put in an appearance at my office almost as soon as I did myself
this morning. He was very chatty & we got on remarkably well together.
Polly astonished me again to-day with another specimen of her strong
mindedness. She went to the Attorney General?s office & took up the cudgels
in my behalf. She is determined I shall be promoted & so I suppose I shall be
if there?s any truth in woman?s determination being always sure to guarantee
success. This was the Quarterly Visiting Day & from ten till four o?clock there
was quite a swarm round the Gaol Gate. Not all those assembled were very
respectable. On the contrary, the most looked hardened & either ex Gaol birds
or candidates for admission to the prison. Two or three were a little drunken
& consequently a little rowdy as well. There was however on the whole very
little trouble. I did not muster but went to the Club where there was a good
228 James Goodall Francis (1819-1884), Premier of Victoria from 1872-74, with Castieau?s
friend George Kerferd in his ministry.


deal of chat going on with regard to Baron von Meuller, the Director of the
Botanical Gardens. 229 The Baron is at loggerheads with the Government &
tried to get the better of it, by lobbying the members of Parliament. The Baron
is however too much of a bore & most people are extremely tired of him. The
Government therefore carried their point without any difficulty & the Baron
got a good wigging for his pains.
I left the Club with Duerdin. In the evening stayed at home & smoked a
new meerschaum which I was extravagant enough to purchase this afternoon.
I gave 15/- for it, a long price but Damman assured me it was a good article.
There was this afternoon a great concert at the Town Hall in order to give the
Common School children a chance to hear & see the organ. Harry was among
4 or 5000 youngsters. The other of our children who go to school were
allowed a holiday. Polly took the little girls to see Aunty Emma & Agnes. I
should have said that Mr Stephen was particularly kind & gentlemanly to
Polly this morning.
September 7 Saturday 1872
Transacted usual business in the Gaol & in the afternoon made up my mind
to go to Sandridge & see the Omeo off for Port Darwin, the road to the last
reputed Eldorado. Dempster went as Surgeon in her & no doubt if the
Diggings prove successful he will be successful also & make a good deal of
money. He is to be paid for his Services, so even if he has to come back again
he will have had a change & be very little out of pocket.
I did not get to Sandridge till it was too late to see the Omeo. She had cleared
out some time before I got down. Walking along the Pier however I met
Duerdin so we joined & walked together for some time. We saw the Sarasan
clear out for New Zealand. The weather was very pleasant & I quite enjoyed
my little outing although it was only to Sandridge. I saw Nicholson the
Superintendent of Police & Mainwaring a detective. The latter told me that
about 300 had gone in the Omeo & that the most of them were hearty healthy
looking fellows who looked as if they meant work. A boatman to whom we
spoke said if any more good news came from the North there would be no
more left in the Colony but cripples, old women & children. Went up to town
by the four o?clock Train. At the Melbourne Station met Kerferd with his
daughter Madeline & her younger sister. Spoke to Kerferd about Polly?s visit
to Francis & Stephen. He seemed to think it was all right but said ?nothing
would be done until the recess.? Went to the Club where Britton & I played
several games of cribbage with McKinley & Telo. We were the conquerors &
had three games to the good when we left off playing. Telo came home
229 Ferdinand von Mueller (1825-1896) was born in Germany and migrated to Adelaide in
1847. He was the First Government Botanist in Victoria for 43 years and was the Director
of the Melbourne Botanical Gardens from 1853 to 1873. He was regarded as 'largely
responsible for the international recognition given to Australian scientific endeavour' in
the nineteenth century ( Australian Dictionary of Biography).


'Port Darwin Rush: The S.S. Omeo Leaving the Sandridge Railway Pier'
Reproduced from The Illustrated Australian News , 10 October 1872, p. 205
according to promise with me this afternoon. Harry was on the lookout for
him & the children (with the exception of Godfrey who has a shy fit just
lately) regularly rushed him. Dotty seems to consider Telo as her special
property & sat on his knee pretty well during the whole of the time she was
in the Dining Room. Of course he had to tell the youngsters a story & of
course he told one about a murder & a trooper & of course it was of thrilling
interest & was listened to with breathless eagerness by the children. After the
children had gone to bed, Telo, myself & Polly (how gallant to put Polly last)
sat talking till past twelve o?clock. Telo then went away & I had just one more
little smoke & then followed Polly who had gone up stairs to bed.
September 8 Sunday 1872
In going round this afternoon, I found in the Male Hospital one poor fellow
who appeared to be dying & when I got to the Female Hospital, there was
an old woman who also appeared to be sinking. The old woman had refused
all nourishment & I asked her if she would like an orange. She faintly
answered ?Yes? & I told Polly who took her some. I am afraid there will be
three Inquests on Monday. There is one woman lying dead now & the man
& woman I have spoken of will scarcely last through the night. None of these
persons though in Gaol have committed any offence except that of being ill
& without friends. The Magistrates too do not send them to prison but from
motives of charity. The Gaol affords them shelter & alas there is but little
shelter for the poor & miserable in Melbourne but the Gaol, the Benevolent
Asylum being full to the brim.


September 10 Tuesday 1872
In the Gaol as usual. The first thing I had to do on going into the office was
to see Mr McDermott, the father of Miss McDermott who teaches our
children music. McDermott had been received on a Fraud Summons but I
did not know about it until I saw him this morning. He wrote a letter to his
daughter which Polly gave her & then went with her to see the detaining
creditor with whom an arrangement was come to but not early enough in
the day to effect the prisoners liberation. Kept myself busy this morning
in writing a paper on the prison Report I have been reading. Was working at
it for some hours. Mustered & then went to the Club. Left with Duerdin &
walked with him up Bourke Street. Polly & the little girls came to meet me
but I missed them & got home long before they did. In the evening went to
my writing again & stuck at it for a couple of hours, then smoked myself
nearly stupid & went away off to bed. Hackett bought for me to-day over �2
worth of leather; the shoeing my family is beginning to be a great
consideration particularly now the prison labor has to be paid for. I can?t help
smiling sometimes when I think how people are deceived as to my means, the
general impression being, ?That I am well off[?]. Dr McGauran came to me
to-day to know if I would buy a poney. He has one which I very much
admired when I saw it the other day. I told him I had no money but the
doctor seemed to treat this as a capital joke. It was not however that I had?ent
the heart to laugh at myself. There is a kind of lull in Melbourne just now,
whether it is the calm before the storm time will show. At any rate we are
beginning to feel in want of stimulant; like dram drinkers, we must have our
regular nips of sensation or we get fidgetty & uneasy. A big nugget or two
from Darwin or Charters Towers would set Victoria topsy-turvy & make the
people anxious to Rush spite of all prudential reasons. Even with the little
cheering intelligence from those distant Fields, numbers are on the move.
One Ballaarat Paper speaking of the excitement warns intending emigrants of
the necessity of being provided with Funds. They say they know of one man
who has gone to Port Darwin with only �5 beyond his Passage money &
naively remark if this man does not starve it will not be his fault but from his
encountering a big slice of luck.
September 11 Wednesday 1872
Lazy this morning. Still in the office in good time. Scribbled away
for some hours at the Article I was writing. Altered the whole of the
Introduction & then let Polly read the Paper. She approved & I felt a little
excited & went away to the Argus office with my production at once. Saw
Haddon, the Editor. 230 He was very gracious & said the Article should appear
but that he could?ent tell when.
230 Frederick William Haddon (1839?1906), journalist, editor of The Argus, founding
trustee of the Yorick Club.


No sooner had I surrendered my Article to the Editor of The Argus than re-
action set in & I mooned over the wisdom or rather the folly of some parts
of it. I could not help thinking over the matter & lying awake in
consequence. I have said what appear to me now some rather severe things
with regard to the management of prisoners at Pentridge & I should like to
obliterate them. Probably I shall wait upon Haddon to-morrow & get him
to let me do so. Certainly there is no reason my being at loggerheads with
either Duncan or Snelling. I feel I am an impulsive fool not to have
waited & reflected before I took the precious ?coinage of my brain? to the
Argus office.
October 1 Tuesday 1872
Up this morning to give out the keys at half past five o?clock, as the work of
the Gaol commenced at half an hour earlier. Mr Duncan was here this
morning & I spoke to him about the Deputy Inspectorship. He did?ent seem
to like the idea of such an appointment being made but expressed himself as
being well disposed towards me & desirous of giving me help if he could but
he did?ent see that a Deputy was required at present. I told him it would not
hurt him & that if I did?ent get it now probably it would be given to some
one by and bye that he would?ent like even as well. He seemed very flurried
& began talking about my firing up at fancied grievances. I told him I might
have acted imprudently but at any rate honestly in the matter. He said he
did?ent like it because others might imitate. I said ?if his Governors imitated
me he would?ent have much to complain of?. We parted apparently on
friendly terms. Mustered in the afternoon & after Muster went to the Club.
In the afternoon I went to the Bank for the Pay. Met Whiteman & asked him
to help me about the Inspector Generalship when the proper time came. He
promised he would do so. In the Evening, went out again ... & went to the
House. Sent up my card to Kerferd who came out almost immediately & had
a chat with me. He told me he had spoken to the Chief Secretary & that Mr
Francis promised not to commit himself in any manner about the Inspector-
ship & that he seemed very well inclined towards me. He advised me to make
no application until the appointment of a Deputy was sanctioned. I thanked
him & came away feeling as if there was something good coming. Went to
the Club where 1 played several games of cribbage with McKinley &
Amsinck. Then walked towards home with Ogier. Got home in time to see
the Argus Reporter who came after ten o?clock.
October 14 Monday 1872
Woke this morning at a little before two o?clock & took the opportunity of
going through the Gaol. Found things apparently all correct, the Warders all
on the alert. In office usual time & got through ordinary business. The
weather very unsettled & almost Wintry. Was not able to muster to-day as


there was a Meeting of the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society & I thought it
best to attend it. There was not much business transacted at the Meeting
beyond the Appointment of a collector, or rather the agreeing to the
advertising for a collector. I walked away from the place of Meeting with Mr
Buckley of Buckley & Nunn?s & when I left him went to the Club. While
there I sent a note to Haddon by Jardine Smith asking him to return the article
I had given him on Prisoners about a month ago as I supposed it was not
accepted & I thought it would do for some paper if it did?ent come up to the
mark of the Leading Journal. He sent me back word ?that he did?ent want to
be rude but he would see me d-d first?. He meant to use it but had not yet had
space to spare. I suppose I must take this as a compliment but if the Article is
to do any good it ought to be published before the public interest about Gaols
is cloyed with the heaps of leaders & paragraphs about prison & prison
discipline which are appearing day by day. Walked towards home with Jardine.
Found when I got home a letter from the Attorney General. He had
received my note and in reply said he had forwarded it to the Chief Secretary
who took a warm interest in the Gaol Bill. He acknowledged the force of
my argument with regard to the rotation of Visiting Trusties but thought
the rotation would have to be given to enable the Bill to be passed through
the House.
October 19 Saturday 1872
In the evening after Polly had got back from Kew I went again down the
street & at the Club met Telo, he did?ent seem to have much to do & we
chummed. First of all I accompanied him to his tailor?s where he possessed
himself of some raiment that he had given to be repaired. After he had
deposited these at home we took a stroll down Bourke Street & just to see
what it was like went into St James Hall, Tickets 1/, Reserved Seats 2/. We
paid a shilling & went up stairs. There was a row as if two men were
quarrelling in the room. We found however this proceeded from the Stage
where Johnny Cowan & someone else were enacting what is professionally
called a ?Black Farce?, that is a farce in which a nigger is introduced & written
for Ethiopian Serenaders. Johnny Cowan is not by any means a bad actor of
his Class & there was I must acknowledge some fun. However I soon grew
a?weary of the stage & what was going on in the way of entertainment &
looked for amusement in the audience. There was not however much to be
found even among them. There were about a hundred & fifty males, mostly
apprentice lads, & two or three women whose dress & style proclaimed them
common property. There was plenty of laughter particularly at anything
painfully extravagant & an apparent satisfaction with the amusement that
was being obtained. Telo & I could not help wondering at there not being
some worthier style of entertainment available for the hundreds in
Melbourne with shillings to spend & an anxiety to dispose of them. Quiet
concerts wont do. I feel certain there must be a certain fastness if not absolute


naughtiness about any night resort that will attract the larrikin & the
wanderer about town. There?s the difficulty: the Entertainer knows not where
exactly to draw the line & for fear of the Police can but give a namby pamby
entertainment just however as vicious if not more so than any more attractive
one he would be glad to offer if sure of non interference. Was home before
ten o?clock & went to bed as soon as I had smoked a pipe.
October 27 Sunday 1872
Lay awake for hours this morning not feeling that I had strength enough to
move. I suffered during the night from clammy cold sweats & shivered in my
bath which is a certain sign with me of being queer all over. Did not go to
Church but did a lot of work of one kind & another in the office. Mustered
in the afternoon & then went for a stroll. Called in at the Club but there was
no one there excepting Mr Major so I did not stay long but after a glance at
the papers came away home again. In the evening I went into town again &
at the Club met McKinley & Levey. Levey asked McKinley who wrote the
article in The Argus of Saturday on ?Prisons & Prisoners?. McKinley replied
?oh I suppose some one who knows something about it?. Levey shook his
head & said ?oh I dont think he does know much about it?. ?lt was?ent one of
the staff I suppose?? From those remarks of Levey?s I suppose I must look out
for squalls for evidently the article will be noticed & that too unfavorably.
Duncan was with Levey yesterday about Exhibition business & I daresay
Gaol matters cropped up & probably my production. 231 Of course as is usual
with me when I get what I want it loses its value. All ready re-action has set
in & I begin to feel I have been a fool to bother about what was said about
Gaols & that I had much rather have kept my ideas to myself. I was too free
yesterday in admitting that I wrote the article in The Argus. Came home
at about nine o?clock. Polly was very unwell all day & lackadaisical in
consequence, lying on the sofa most of the time. Mrs Smith was with us in
the afternoon & I lent her some books. Before I went out this evening Mr
Dobson & Katey Morphy called & did a little romantic walking in our
garden while we were having our tea. I wrote to Kerferd to-day complaining
of Snelling having received his promotion & begging him to look after me or
else that I feared being left out in the cold. I called his attention to the article
in The Argus & asked him if he had not read it to glance over it. Felt very
unwell even when I went to bed. I was so troubled with acidity of stomach
that I took carbonate of soda three times during the day in the hopes it would
relieve me. Some change I must get or else I feel that I shall be knocked up
entirely. It is the bothering money that is the nuisance. If I had plenty of that
I would soon have a trip & give Polly a trip that would set us both up.
231 Castieau's article may have been published in the supplement to The Argus, 26 Oct 1872.
It is not in the regular part of the paper.


October 28 Monday 1872
Tolerably busy all day, but did not feel at all well. Saw Dr McCrea in the
afternoon & he had seen by the Books that Dr McGauran had prescribed an
emetic for me the day before, so he said ?I see you have been going into
emetics since my last visit?. I said ?Yes?. ?How are your bowels?? was the next
question & I said ?much too open?. ?What, since the emetic?? I was fairly
caught & blundered out ?Yes?, not liking to acknowledge I had not taken the
medicine. However I did?ent feel comfortable at having deceived the doctor
so before he went away I told him the truth & said I would take the emetic
in the evening. Went to the Club & left it with Duerdin. When I got home
& had tea I courageously went up stairs to my bed room & took the emetic.
I suffered for more than an hour & then was well enough to go down stairs.
Annie Foreman was playing bagatelle with our youngsters.
Polly seems very unwell. She is hankering for a change & will I suppose
before long get it. I wish we had lots of money. Then I would only be too
pleased for her to spend some of it in getting a change of scene.
November 3 Sunday 1872
Got up this morning feeling considering my losses of yesterday very well &
tolerably good tempered. Took the little girls, Harry & Walter to church.
Mustered in the afternoon, in the evening or rather by the five o?clock train went
to Hawthorn & then on to Kew. Found Morison & Pilcher at Kerferd?s. The
Solicitor General was amiable & we soon got into a chat about business matters.
Kerferd said he was afraid some one had been speaking against me to Francis for
he said the other day ?I talked too much?. This must have been Duncan & no
doubt was the result of my candidly telling that gentleman I was trying to
become his Deputy. I saw then he did?ent like it & suppose having the ear of the
Chief Secretary he has damned me with faint praise. I do not think he has the
pluck knowing that I have friends to censure me directly. Kerferd advised me
however to keep quiet & wait. Mr Stephen had shown Kerferd my letter &
Kerferd thought I had better not write again. It is troubled waters Government
officials flounder about in; no doubt if they wish to float, the quieter they keep
themselves the better. It is hard however for some constitutions. Left Kerferd?s
in time to catch the quarter past nine o?clock train. Got home at ten o?clock
leaving Morison & Pilcher in Bourke Street. Wore to-day for the first time a
paper collar. I have always turned up my nose at them but on Saturday as I was
walking with Jardine Smith he turned into a shop & bought a box of collars.
They looked very nice & as I had collars nearly worn out I bought a box also &
found the one I wore to-day very comfortable.
November 9 Saturday 1872
Here I am at Half past two A.M. Sunday morning filling up my Diary because
I find I cannot sleep & must do something to occupy my time. This day,


Saturday [Derby Day], has been an unhappy one for me, though if all things
were as they should be I ought to have been taking pleasure like the rest of
Melbourne. There has been however no pleasure for me for a long time. 1 am
in a streak of bad luck & everything goes crossly. As it was the Prince of Wales?
Birthday as many of the Warders as could be spared were allowed Leave. I went
into the office at the usual time & McNee soon put in an appearance. After the
Discharges, I went through the Property Book & found to all appearance I was
Fourteen or Fifteen pounds short of the cash my book showed me I ought to
have. How it happens puzzles me to know. I do not like to think I have been
robbed, or that the Book has been tampered with. One however of the two
things must I am convinced have taken place for I have carefully kept account
of all money expended & there is the amount I am missing deficient. ?lt never
rains but it pours? is an old adage & bad luck seems to have settled on my
shoulders this year. I am wretched & have no comfort in doing my work or in
any of the pursuits of life. The Penal Department Red Tape will be found
wound round my heart whenever a Post Mortem is held on my remains. Mr
Duncan, taking advantage of the Holiday I suppose, bounced in this morning
& began at me about the memos I had written. He took considerable
advantage of his position as Head of the Department & bullied for a time
accusing me of impertinence & disingenuousness. I answered him back for a
time telling him the Gaol was becoming demoralised & that he wanted to do
me an injury. He repudiated this & gradually quieted down. We then went in
for a quiet talk & inconsistendy enough I admit talked away as if we were on
intimate terms. Duncan is a great villain, or else I have done him wrong, for he
talks fairly enough to me & seems as if he wished me well. I have never been
open enough to say to him what is the fact that makes it impossible for me to
get on satisfactorily with the Penal Department but there is no doubt it is
Snelling. He has worked for his own Promotion at the expense of myself & the
other officers in charge of Gaols, been regardless of any worry & annoyance he
might occasion so long as he could score a few more letters or returns to add to
the number ?the Office? put through. Verily he has had his Reward, he is
promoted & I who have had most of the extra work and responsibility have
been left out in the cold.
November 12 Tuesday 1872
In the Gaol as usual this morning. Last night Mr Rusden read a paper at a
meeting of the Royal Society on the subject of prisoners. He recommended in it
that habitual criminals should be at once arrested & kept for ever in
confinement on the theory that their constitutions prevented their resisting
the temptation to commit crime. While in Gaol, Mr Rusden proposed to
utilise them by making them the tests of all sorts of medical & surgical
experiments. He would divide the Criminals into three classes. The little
offenders he would simply experiment on so far as trying the effects of a new
drug or medicine, but the man who had committed a capital offence would


be made to undergo any operation even though danger to life attended it. I
saw him at the Club to-night & helped with Walstab & others to chaff him
considerably. He bore it all however very good naturedly. I told him as soon
as vivisection & other similar amusements were tolerated in Gaols, the
Government would have to look out for another Gaoler as I would?ent
undertake the superintendence under a system that would permit such
barbarities. 232
November 22 Friday 1872
In the Gaol as usual this morning. Busied myself after I had got through
ordinary work in the office in writing a leader not to send to any Newspaper
but just to relieve my feelings after the style of Traddles (I think it was
Traddles) in David Copperfield , who used to write letters to the Duke of
Wellington & other eminent & celebrated individuals when he was excited
by any thing out of the common run of events. My Leader was of course
about Gaols & in it I expressed the feelings I have with regard to what ought
to be the proper position of a Governor of a Gaol. Showed it to Polly & I
suppose shall do no more with it. Polly went to Elsternwick to-day to see if
Julia could go down there to stay & Dotty?s nurse take her place here for a
time. Julia has been very unwell for a considerable time past & is now very
weak indeed. I did not muster to-day but stayed at home & read till after tea.
In the evening 1 went to the Club. There I met Henry Smith & paid him a
pound which he had won of me on the Derby. I reminded him that he had
promised to say a good word for me to Mr Francis if he got the chance & he
acknowledged he had done so & would whenever an opportunity occurred.
Henry Smith is the Head of the Argus Reporting Staff & has considerable
influence with the Chief Secretary. He showed me a snuffbox ?The Chief? as
he termed him gave him a short time ago.
November 25 Monday 1872
In the office at usual time this morning. Mr Duncan came at a little after nine
o?clock & stayed for some time chatting in a very friendly manner on different
subjects. After he had left I went into the Women?s Gaol & tried a number of
females for different offences. There was one great brute, Catherine Jesson, to
whom I found it necessary to administer two days Solitary Confinement.
Upon my decision being given Kate immediately began to bully & to
threaten; when she was got into her Cell she tore her clothing. I directed that
she should be put into a strait waistcoat, & sent a couple of warders to Mrs
Gee?s assistance. The waistcoat was put on but it was afterwards reported to
me that the prisoner had got it off. I was not going to be beaten in that way
232 Similarly The Argus could not agree that crime was simply a 'physical disorder' and regarded
Rusden's comments as those of an 'earnest and advanced disciple' of a 'cold-blooded social
school': The Argus, 15 November 1872, p. 4.


& so directed that it should be put on again. The warders were sent in &
helped the women who had to put on the restraint. There was a regular battle
royal & then Jesson had to be carried to the punishment cell cursing like a very
trooper & using as much violence as she could with the crowd that were
holding her. As she passed me she delivered herself of a torrent of abuse & I
must say I received a gentle reminder of my beginning to fall into the sere &
yellow life; previously when any thing pretty has been said to me & I have
been called out of my name, it has been prefixed by ?little?, as ?Oh you little -
Jesson this afternoon dropped the ?little? & grinding her teeth exclaimed
?Oh you old ??. When I went to muster about an hour afterwards this
specimen of the gentler sex was sitting singing in her cell. She had got every
scrap of clothing gathered up round her waist or up to the strait waistcoat &
was sitting with her lower extremities all naked cross legged like a tailor ...
November 28 Thursday 1872
This was Sissy?s birthday. She is ten years old to-day. Mamma made her a
present & so did Mr Brown. I bought her a fan & the whole of the things
she got made the little Puss appear very happy. I went into Melbourne this
morning & in Collins Street met Judge Cope. The old gentleman thinks if
the Supreme Court Judges get increased salaries there will be a chance for the
County Court Judges also to get a rise. Mustered in the afternoon. After
Muster went to the Club, came away with Duerdin. There was some rain
again in the evening. Annie Forman had her tea with our children in honor
of Sissy?s birthday. While I was in town this morning I met Nathan & made
arrangements with him for the renewal of the Bill he has of mine. Money
matters are very bad with me & I cannot see how ever I am to get square
again. There was sometime ago a great talk about Judge Pohlman. 233 In a
moment of weakness the old chap appears to have yielded to the lusts of the
flesh & to have been too loving with his housekeeper. Their commerce
resulted in the lady losing her shape & the old judge made the best of the
matter & married her. Now Judge Pohlman had been a leading member of
the Morality Committee, in fact he had been a shining light among all
societies favored by the ?unce guid? & there was a general lifting up of eyes in
horror when the poor judge?s weakness was hinted at. I for one have known
Mr Pohlman for a very long time & I never knew anything of him but that
rebounded to his credit. He has been liberal & kind almost to a fault, strictly
conscientious & painstaking, in fact from over anxiety to do right he has
earned the character of being slow & tedious. I have always looked upon
Judge Pohlman as being really a good man & it only shows how weak the best
can be at times. Instead of flinging a stone at the old fellow I would give him
credit for having acted honorably under the circumstances & condoned the
injury he had done to the partner of his foolishness by marrying her.
233 Robert Williams Pohlman (1811-1877), country court judge.


The Judge?s morality friends however have acted differently, for at a
meeting of the Religious Tract Distribution Society of which the Judge has
for a long time been a Vice President, the Dean of Melbourne expressed his
regret at the scandal that had existed & pointedly alluded to the ?falling off?
of one who they had all thought so well of, Rev. Mr Strongman obsequiously
taking the Dean?s cue proposed that Judge Pohlman?s name be taken off the
list of Vice Presidents & the slight was passed upon his honor without
apparently a dissentient voice. Mr T.T A?Beckett who was appointed Vice
President wrote at once to the Secretary of the Society & declined to accept
office after the slight that had been put upon his friend Judge Pohlman. This
letter was published in the Papers & The Argus & Telegraph wrote Leading
Articles complimentary to the Judge?s character & sympathising with him.
The Dean & his merry men were as may be supposed pretty severely handled
& serve ?em right.
December 2 Monday 1872
Mr Duncan came in this morning shortly after I had taken my seat at the
desk. He chatted away in a friendly manner enough & informed me on my
enquiry that the Reformatory Boys were to be removed to Pentridge, to what
were the quarters for the females, consequently there is little prospect of the
women being taken away from the Gaol at any rate for a considerable time.
Transacted ordinary business during the morning. In the afternoon Mr Sturt
put in an appearance & I attended upon him. The old gentleman was rather
queer, seemed to have been primed by some one for he began to make
objections to what he had always previously appeared to have been favorable
to viz, the asking the prisoners in the different Yards if they wished to make
any complaints. This system I have always found a wise one though it is
contrary to the Regulations now in force. Mr Sturt also found fault with the
office thinking it was not solemn enough for a Court. By Jove if he would
only be a little less believing & punish prisoners according to the evidence
against them & not according to their own statements, he might try in a barn
as effectively as in a Court House with Bench, Dock & other &c?s of Justice.
He is a good old fellow however & I hope while I am Governor he will
continue to be VJ. Miss Fowler & Miss McDermott had their tea at our
house to-night & in the evening Polly went with them to a Concert given for
Giozza?s Benefit at the Town Hall. 234 While Polly was away I read to Harry &
234 The Argus, 3 December 1872, p. 3. The benefit was for Milanese-born conductor, performer
and composer Paolo Giorza (1830-1914), with a performance of his Messe Solonnelle, which
Polly also took Sissy to see and hear at St Francis' Roman Catholic Church on Christmas
Day three weeks later. Giorza was musical director for the Sydney International Exhibition
in 1879, for which he composed a number of items such as the 'Manly Beach Polka' and
the 'Australia March' (held at the National Library of Australia). For more information
about Giorza's concerts in Australia, see also Katharine Brisbane, Entertaining Australia:
An Illustrated History (Sydney: Currency Press, 1991), p. 95.


Dotty one of the Ingoldsby?s Legends & then Nathan came & I paid him �5
& renewed a Bill for �lO5. I told him I was very hard up & that I should
have to get some more money & that if I could?ent get it without I must give
a Bill of Sale over my furniture. Nathan offered to let me have another �IOO
if I would give a Bill of Sale. I said I would think of it.
December 3 Tuesday 1872
In the office as usual. After I had got through the urgent portion of the work
I went into town to pay off the portion of the Loan due at the Australian
Alliance Office. In Collins Street I met Joe who hailed me as being a
?tremendous swell?. I had a frock coat & a big bouquet, both together
knocked Joe all of a heap. Went to the bank of N.S. Wales & paid in �lO to
my credit, met Dempster & walked a little way together. Then he went off
to the Swanston Street Station & I to a barber?s in Elizabeth Street where I
got my hair cut. Miss McDermott had her dinner with us. I tried to persuade
Polly to go out this afternoon but she was too lazy & declined although she
had nearly got ready. Did not muster, but was about the Gaol while Muster
was going on. Went to the Yorick & left with Duerdin. Things are becoming
more & more English every day. Passing the Eastern Market I noticed some
pottles of strawberries got up quite in Covent Garden style & only sixpence
each. I bought a pottle as the basket is quite a new thing in Melbourne. The
strawberries were worth the sixpence. I was in the Exhibition for a little while
this afternoon & met a Mr Grover who I had known or met at Beechworth.
I forget I am sure what position he is in; he was along with Brown, the
Sporting Correspondent of The Argus. Played bagatelle in the evening for
some time. Mrs Smith came over to see Polly. She had been spending the day
at Elsternwick with Dotty. This was rather a hot day & so before we got into
bed Polly & I both indulged in a bath. Harry went to bed in disgrace to-night
before six o?clock having told his mamma a fib. Harry cannot lie, for he soon
confesses his untruthfulness.
December 13 Friday 1872
This morning before I got up Polly called my attention to a Warder in the
Garden of Rowley taking charge of prisoners who were Weeding. He was
sitting down reading a newspaper while the men he had charge of were doing
pretty well as they pleased. The warder turned out to be Kelly, a man who I
have noticed frequently as being very careless indeed in the performance of
his duty. When I went into the office I spoke my mind to him very freely. He
did?ent seem at all to like it, but I was savage & could?ent help showing my
teeth. Was very restless all the day & took too much to drink. This did not
improve my temper & I was in a very queer way when I returned from the
Club where I went so soon as I had finished muster. Came away from the
Club with Jardine Smith & Duerdin. Purves was at my house when I got


home. He wanted an order for some lady friend of his to see Mount. I
willingly assented. Instead of having tea I took to raving at Polly who with
no doubt the best of motives tried to prevent my taking any thing to drink.
She did harm however instead of good for her interference & refusal to give
me the keys of the cupboard made me obstinate & determined. I talked
wildly & played the fool till I got what I wanted, then I poured out some
grog & smoked till I was tired. Polly then became affectionate & I repentant.
It ended as our rows generally do, in my acknowledging how wrong I had
been & Polly showing her fondness for my unworthy self in every way she
possibly could. We went to bed very early & I soon got to sleep.
December 19 Thursday 1872
Woke this morning with a sore throat & great oppression on the chest. Found
I had got a very bad cold. Went into the Court. It took some time to start, but
at length, the Jury were sworn & the Trial of Mount & Morris for murdering a
man name unknown on board the British Ship Carl, commenced. 235 The Crown
was represented by Adamson, Garnett & McKinley, instructed by the Crown
Solicitor in person. The prisoners were defended by Messrs Ireland &
Molesworth. Great interest was taken throughout the case & many notables
were present. The Miss Irelands & some other ladies were in the Court. Winch
prompted the Crown when anything was overlooked. The Witness he had
brought from Sydney, Fallon, was the one who gave the strongest evidence
against the prisoners. He detailed fully the story of the Kidnapping & related
that after a fight with the Natives who resisted being captured & swam for their
lives, Morris on two occasions deliberately shot and killed a black man, also that
on one occasion when the boat was returning to the ship four or five wounded
natives in the water were passed. Mount who was in charge of the boat refusing
to take them on Board, saying that they were no use. The poor wretches were
thus left to perish. The case was continued till about seven o?clock when the Jury
were locked up. The Court adjourned till the morning. Polly was down at St
Kilda this morning. She reported that Mrs Littlewood had had a miscarriage &
was very ill in consequence. I went to the Club for a litde while.
December 20 Friday 1872
My throat & chest were still very painful. Went to the Court & remained
there for some time. Heard Mr Ireland address the Jury. His defence was that
the prisoners committed no murder on the date fixed. This was the night
when there was so much shooting into the Hold. He argued that all the
natives who were killed were shot by Murray & others, not the prisoners, the
next morning when they fired through the bulk-heads. The learned
235 The killing of Melanesians at Bougainville by labour traders Murray (who was tried in
Sydney), Morris and Mount was much discussed by Castieau. See entries for 20, 23, 26
November 1872.


counsel drew a plausible picture of the utter barbarism of the Figians, spoke
of the cannibal husband, the cannibal wife & the cannibal baby, said the
Labor traffic was absolutely necessary in order that the fairest islands in the
world should be brought under proper culture & their inhabitants civilised
& christianised. He pointed out that the Licenses given to ships to procure
labor was an admission of the necessity of the traffic, a traffic which could
not be carried on successfully without some amount of violence. He implied
that the Natives got what they brought upon themselves, not in an attempt
to Escape but in the endeavour to revenge their loss of liberty by siezing the
ship & murdering & eating their late captors. Mr Ireland denounced Dr
Murray & laid the atrocity that was committed on the doctor?s shoulders.
The Chief Justice summed up against the prisoners though he gave Mount
some credit for having on two occasions acted with an appearance of
humanity. The Jury retired at six o?clock & at ten brought in a verdict of
aggravated manslaughter against the prisoners. The Judge said there was no
such offence as aggravated manslaughter & the verdict was recorded as one
of Manslaughter.
December 21 Saturday 1872
Chest still very painful, but no worse for which I feel thankful. Attended at
the Court & saw it started. Was about the Gaol the whole of the day &
mustered in the afternoon. Little Dotty went off to Geelong this afternoon
with Aunty Emma. Agnes & Joe Lotherington came to our house & had tea,
Harriette called & also went to see Mrs Smith. I walked to the Railway
Station with Harriette & saw there two of her pupils, the Miss Stephens & a
young man who was introduced to me as a Mr Stephen & who was I suppose
their brother. Went to the Club for a while & then came home in time for
tea. In the evening, Polly took Sissy to the market. Joe, Agnes & her brothers
went with them.
My people got back at a little after nine o?clock & Polly & myself were
quietly having our toddy when there came a knock at the door & on Polly
going to it she found Julia?s old beau. Julia had gone to bed & so Polly had a
fine chance of asking the young man his intentions. She began to talk to him
plainly & openly, but I got fidgetty for she kept on too long & did all the
talking herself instead of letting the young fellow express himself. I could not
hear what was being said but jabber, jabber, jabber went on unceasingly for
half an hour. When Polly came back to the room she was wild with me
because I said it would have been better for her not to have talked so much.
She said the man would?ent go away & to that I answered well then I would
have said ?Good Night? & left him. Polly was very cross with me for this & I
got my share of a lecture & we went off to bed in a pet.
Was disturbed after I had been in bed about an hour by the female officer
coming for the keys & after I had given them out & gone to bed again was


awoke again an hour or two after by another ring. The keys were wanted
again there being a woman in the horrors of drink who could not be
managed. The poor wretch was making a great row & was evidently
surrounded by devils who terrified her beyond endurance. Having I suppose
been weak enough to make no fuss about Weachurch being left on my hands,
the Penal Dept, have had a happy thought & seen a way of getting rid of
troublesome prisoners by sending them to the Gaol. Yesterday a fellow, half
mad I believe, but who had made himself famous from assaulting Warders,
was sent in to the Gaol on the plea that the Chief Medical Officer wished to
have an opportunity of examining him. Mark you, there is a Resident Medl.
officer at Pentridge.
December 31 Tuesday 1872
This has been altogether the hardest year I have had. Business has been
altogether unpleasantly conducted & a great deal of worry has been entailed
upon me in consequence. For nearly four months I was without a Chief Clerk
& had to do most of the work that belongs to such an official. Then the
constant nagging of Snelling has irritated me & been a perpetual blister. The
red-tape of the office has been prodigious. Among other things, over a
hundred Circulars have been launched at the heads of Governors of Gaols. 1
honestly confess to have no knowledge of more than ten of them & I know
that the alteration they have caused in the management of this Gaol is
infmitessemal. The prisoners get an extra blanket now. This is a change, but
from my thinking not one for the better. Duncan probably means well but has
fallen into the mistake of thinking everything in the Gaol Department wanted
altering. He & his trusty Chief Clerk have upon this supposition treated the
Governors of Gaols as enemies & heaped Penal regulations upon them at the
same time carefully avoiding to relieve them of any of their responsibility.
After twenty years of experience & honest intention to be called to account &
instructed by those who I can but feel are not more intelligent & less practiced
than myself makes me very bilious at times & with money troubles added, has
made me over & over wish I had never seen the Gaol or become acquainted
with the meannesses & trickeries of the Civil Service.


Chapter 6: 1874
'The difficulties of my position'
Castieau kept a diary in 1873, or so it seems from the entry for New Year?s
Day in 1874: ?Seem very pleased to get back to my old fashioned style
of Diary, the other was very awkward & I never rightly got accustomed to
it?. 236 Perhaps economy had driven him in 1873 to the cheaper foolscap-size
diary that he later used for sporadic comment during 1877?79 ?it cost
25.6 d. compared to the Bor 10/- he paid for his preferred Lett?s Diary No. 8.
The record for 1873 would have been uncomfortable for other reasons as
well: the humiliation of his arrest in demeaning circumstances in May of that
year, and his subsequent demotion. All the work of solid preparation for a
promotion had seemingly gone to waste. The determination to start anew in
1874 is evident in the optimism of the account of the first few days of the
new year.
Inevitably the mood could not be sustained. There were further
disappointments to come. Failure to gain a promotion, which might have
brought relief from the constant burden of debt and envy and lessened
Castieau?s sense of failure, continued as he watched others around him
progress. For instance, he saw his friend from Beechworth days, George
Kerferd, assume the mantle of Premier of Victoria. Castieau was still close
enough to pay the Kerferds a regular Sunday visit, but the tone had changed
with George?s elevation. Castieau sensed condescension (?The Prime Minister
was cordial enough but yet seemed to have an innate consciousness of the
dignity of his position?) and confided to the diary his wish that Francis had
remained in power, and Kerferd just a minister in the government. 237
The Castieaus were left managing both debt and ill-health throughout the
year. In the process Polly?s strengths came to the fore. The devotion evident at
the beginning of the year finds expression in her determination later in the
year to address the family?s pressing financial problems. The result is a
remarkably detailed portrait of Victorian household management as Polly
takes on the business of meeting creditors and using her wiles to extract
reasonable terms for settling debt, while also displaying admirable firmness in
dealing with the more hard-headed businessmen who resist her proposals.
When, at the end of her week-long efforts to resolve the demands of the
creditors, one of them presents a bill for immediate payment of �5 her
response is determined: ?the man cant have it & there?s an end of the matter?. 238
236 Diary, 1 January 1884.
237 Diary, 30 August 1874.
238 Diary, 4 July 1874.


Polly?s intervention in the management of their affairs reflects also Castieau?s
growing physical incapacity at this time. A succession of illnesses in May and
June 1874 prompted discussion of a long break, even of returning to England
for a time. In September a complete physical breakdown involving severe
rheumatism and other symptoms left Castieau incapacitated for the better
part of two months, during which he was unable to keep the diary. There was
again discussion of him returning Home for a while, and his journalist friends
encouraged newspaper speculation of a grand tour to investigate penal
methods in other countries. The speculation came to nothing?Castieau had
recovered by mid-November to a point where he took a rehabilitative trip to
Beechworth, Wangaratta and Albury, renewing his acquaintance with the
district whose fortunes had coincided with his own career only a few years
before. It was not Home, although the break was welcome. In spite of The
Argus and The Age each supporting a trip to visit European prisons, Castieau?s
year ended in disappointment at Kerferd?s indifference to the proposal.
Home remained the ever-distant prospect, perhaps better avoided in any
case, for Castieau?s real and imagined physical decline might have been
aggravated by too close an acquaintance with his father. Shortly before
Christmas 1874, the family received letters from John Buckley Sr in England,
enclosing self-portraits of the 84-year-old survivor of the Napoleonic wars, ?a
hale hearty, upright old chap ... without stick or spectacles?. Castieau?s
maudlin commentary on this revelation was prescient: ?I could not help
thinking that he has more life in him than his son is in possession of?. 239
January 1 Thursday 1874
Seem very pleased to get back to my old fashioned style of Diary, the other was
very awkward & I never rightly got accustomed to it. Woke up early & received
a hearty kiss from Polly & a sincere wish from her heart, I know, for my future
health & happiness. She would most unselfishly insist upon my going out to-
day & packed me away by nine o?clock. I went to Sandridge almost wishing to
miss the Train so that I should be too late for a boat that was going to
Queenscliff. I was however just in time & got on the pier at Sandridge just as
the Williams was quite full & ready to start for Queenscliffe. I trod the gangway
of this vessel & soon found myself on board of her with about 700 others. The
weather was glorious & we had a capital trip although we were very crowded. I
met Sandilands & Hornby, two Melbourne Solicitors. The first is a great friend
of Kerferd?s. There were a few others on board also that I knew but not nearly
as many as I had expected to have met. Sandilands crossed over to Portsea & I
went with Hornby to the Queensland Hotel where we arrived just in time for a
good dinner. After dinner Hornby took me for a little walk & I did the light-
house & the Beach. Crowds that had arrived by the steamers were sensibly
239 Diary, 14 December 1874.


making little picnic parties & enjoying provisions they had brought with them.
The beach is such a nice sandy one that it quite made me wish to run about
barefooted on it & more than once did I wish for the wife & children & a game
of romps with them on the edge of or even in the water.
My acquaintance Hornby was to stay at Queenscliffe, so I started for home
by myself. The steamer soon crowded & off we went. I met Mr Strachan
going home & we chatted together for a little while. I saw his wife &
daughter but was not introduced to them, fancy however my not being so
was owing to my own awkwardness. Reached Sandridge by half past seven &
got home in an hour after. Polly came running out of the house to meet me,
all had been well at home. Master Harry had however been giving himself airs
& had at last got a whipping as he deserved.
The English Cricketers were playing to-day at Ballaarat. They did a great
deal better there than at Melbourne & when the stumps were drawn to-night
the Englishmen who had gone in first were 225 runs for three wickets down.
Bertie was to come to-day but a telegram was sent this morning telling us not
to expect him.
January 2 Friday 1874
This was generally felt to be a terribly hot day. Many old colonists went as far
as to affirm that it was the hottest day they had ever experienced. Memory
however is scarcely to be trusted on such subjects. The first reminder that I
had of its being extra hot was a Report from the Labor Yard that one of the
men employed there had had a fit & had been sent to the Hospital. This was
no doubt caused by the heat. The man recovered in an hour or two but had
evidently been really unwell. One of the Warders also was invalided by the
Medical Officer. I was employed in the office the whole of the day & mustered
after. After Muster I went to the Club. The principal topic of conversation was
of course regarding the heat. Harrison, Editor of The Geelong Advertiser & I
left together & as it was the beginning of the year we made that the excuse this
time for having a drink. Just then up came Smith the Chief of the Argus
Reporting Staff & we could?ent well have our drink without asking him to
join us. I had some shandy-gaff & found myself minus 1/6. I could not help
as I walked home moralising on the folly of this wretched drinking &
shouting, this extravagant waste of money, 1/6 actually pitched into the
publican?s till without any return worthy of as many pence as it had cost
sixpences. I made up my mind once more not to give way to the evil habit
feeling that while I did there was little chance of my getting all right again.
Bertie arrived by the afternoon train & I was very glad of it for if he had
stayed till night it would have put us to some inconvenience. He was ordered
to join his ship to-day, so at about eight o?clock he went away to
Williamstown. I should?ent wonder however if he comes to Melbourne again
before the ship leaves for England.


The English Cricketers have had things pretty well their own way at
Ballaarat; they scored 470 for their first innings. The two Graces each made
over 100. 240
Played Croquet with the little girls for a time & a game of cricket with the
boys & Bertie. Went away to bed soon after ten o?clock.
January 3 Saturday 1874
Money, Money, Money. How to get it & how to keep it. I seem to
understand How to spend it & evidently that is all I know about the
bothering worrying mischievous ?root?. Strict economy is now my motto &
yet I find it frittered away without any show for it again to-day. Sissy came
in from Elsternwick with Kitty Hall & took Dotty & Kitty away with them.
There are now no little girls at our house. I could have better spared all the
boys than Sissy & Dotty.
This afternoon by Post I received a letter addressed to me in a villainous
hand but with a Lion rampant as the seal of the envelope. On opening this I
found a carefully closed parcel & on opening this another still more closely
protected, on opening that still another parcel shut up like the others. This
however I did?ent bother with for I could read through it some beastly words
and knew then that the whole thing was what my larrikin friends would call
a ?sell?.
There was every appearance when we got up this morning of our having
another roaster but though during the day the weather was particularly
muggy there was little sun & the heat in consequence was not nearly so great
as on Yesterday. I was tolerably busy all the morning in the office & finished
up by going to the Bank. Dotty & Kitty went into Collins Street with me as
they had to call for some portraits. Met Turner the Beechworth Jeweller. He
was in company with Mr Berry formerly Sub Treasurer at Beechworth & now
the occupant of a Masonic Almshouse, having been dispensed with for
economy?s sake by the McCulloch Government & having lost his few
hundreds of compensation money in Mining Specs.
Did my business at the Bank, met my little girls & hurried back to
business. Mr Duncan came shortly afterwards & remained chatting for a
considerable time. He professed to have no idea why the Cabinet ignored my
application for Promotion except as a punishment for the slip I made. I told
him that I fancied there must be something else & that I would try & find
out if it were so.
There had been some considerable excitement at Pentridge this morning,
as the factory in which wool is made into blankets was found to be on fire.
240 Very likely Dr Edward 'The Coroner' Grace and his brother W.G. Grace, though there was
a third brother, Frederick, in the famous cricketing family. Edward and 'W.G.' represented
England in the first-ever Test in England against Australia, in 1880.


It seemed that the building had been duly inspected by three different
officials & that everything was pronounced to be all right. Three hours
afterwards however a fire was discovered, fortunately in time for there was
very little damage done. Had the danger however not been perceived for an
hour longer, thousands of pounds worth of machinery and stores would
probably have been destroyed. The fires in the Engine room are it appears put
out on Friday nights and consequently there was less to be apprehended than
on other nights when a little fire was retained to prevent delay in getting up
steam the next day. There was no work except cleaning & such like on
Saturdays. Mr Duncan seemed satisfied the fire was accidental & if he be
correct, the machinery must have heated & charred the beams of the roof or
some of the wool must have ignited by spontaneous combustion. I urged
upon Mr Duncan the necessity of the most careful enquiry into the origin of
the fire as if it were not the result of accident but the work of an incendiary,
he might look out for another attempt. Stayed about the Gaol all the
afternoon & after four o?clock went to the Club. Read a lot of papers there
& got home in good time for tea. The Ballaarat cricketers were making a
good score & the game was likely to be drawn for want of time. Bertie Newell
came up from his ship this afternoon & Harry & he went off to the
Pantomime at the Opera House. The Pantomime is the production of
Garnett Walsh 241 a local author &is highly spoken of. Harry liked it much.
January 6 Tuesday 1874
I had scarcely sat down to my dinner when a knock came at the door & I was
told after it had been answered that I was wanted. In the drawing room I
found a Mr Godwin from Wellington, New Zealand who had brought a note
from Cowderoy introducing him & asking me to show him over the Gaol. I
asked Mr Godwin into lunch & chatted with him till two o?clock, then I
went with him through the Gaol. Mr Godwin led me to understand that he
was likely to be the Secretary of a Penal Commn. about to be appointed at
Wellington & so I showed him all that I could of our Gaol. The crowded
state of it & the business going on of one kind or another made I have no
doubt things appear very strange to him, particularly as with my usual luck
neither Quin nor Nixon were in the New Wing & Adams who was in charge
was in a disagreeable humour & though respectful when spoken to did?ent
make himself appear either as smart or as sharp as he could have done. After
we had seen the Hospital which did not look well either as the doctor was
there & a crowd of out patients around him, we went to the Labor Yards. The
boys seemed getting along very well but when I took the New Zealander on
to the Tower & showed him the men?s labor yard I was very much ashamed
241 Garnet Walch, journalist, dramatist, also secretary of the Athenaeum (formerly the
Mechanics Institute) in Collins Street. The Athenaeum had a subscription library which
Castieau joined later in 1874.


of it. The Warder on the Tower & the Warder in the Labor Yard were off their
guard & did not catch sight of us smartly while a number of the prisoners
were idling altogether or napping away in a manner well calculated to express
a beholder with the idea that they were doing a more than usually powerful
Government Stroke. We went into the Yard & then I was glad to see that the
Heaps broken during the day were much better than might have been
expected under the circumstances.
January 10 Saturday 1874
In Gaol in good time & feeling tolerably salubrious. Very busy all the
morning. At about a quarter to two Mr Duncan called. I was in the house
just about commencing a smoke after dinner when I was informed that the
D G was waiting to see me. He said he had just called in because he had?ent
been during the week & that he wanted nothing. Mr D looked I thought
very much worried. Polly asked me to take her to the Fitzroy Gardens in
order that we might hear what is called the Head Quarters Band play. Johnny
& Ernest were allowed to go with us, the weather came on very hot indeed
for although there was no bright sun there were Bush fires all around which
scorched the atmosphere. We saw Mrs Morphy & Katey, also Mrs Elliot &
her mother. Polly riled me because she got very excited & would rave against
all the people she saw. They were a set of dowdies, the girls were badly dressed
& the men were idiots. At length Jardine Smith put in an appearance & Polly
tripped off to him just to show Mrs Elliot that any rate if there was a
gentleman about she was acquainted with him. Afterwards Semple & Keeley
joined Smith, there was a very great argument about the heights of Bosisio,
Zanoni & Ribaldi the well known vocalists; Keeley maintaining that Ribaldi
was the tallest whereas Polly insisted that Bosisio was. There was a great deal
of loud talking before the subject dropped. I went away with Keeley, Smith
& Semple leaving Polly to grumble away with her female friends. We went
to a hostelry at Richmond where we had beer & drank it as tho we were
thirsty, we talked a great deal of nonsense & some little sense, then Keeley
went home & I, Smith & Semple took a cab and rode into town. Semple &
Smith went in for something to eat at the Club & I started away for home.
In Swanston Street however I was tempted to go in for some oysters. When
I got home Polly was very cross & accused me of rudeness in going away from
her at the Gardens. I retaliated by blaming her for being so ill natured in her
talk about the promenadors. Went early to bed.
January 11 Sunday 1874
When I was at the Club to-night I bought a cigar to smoke when I got home,
for Polly this morning broke my pipe because she caught one of the servants
smoking it. Polly was very indignant & pitched into Elizabeth hot & strong.
I expect however Elizabeth cared the most about being deprived of her smoke.


I did?ent feel very angry about the matter as I knew that I should?ent have left
my pipe about as when a woman has a penchant for smoking she is not
likely to resist the temptation of having a whiff if she finds pipe & tobacco
within reach of her hand. Polly was disgusted at the idea of the woman using
my pipe but she does?ent know how careless folk become in this respect.
Many in other respects particular if not fastidious persons will take a pipe
from the mouth of another man & not think anything of the piggishness of
the action. If Polly had?ent broken my pipe I daresay when the inclination
for a smoke came upon me I should have used it & not fancied it any the
fouler because I knew it had been between the lips of somebody else. I
should?ent wonder if Lizzey has?ent had many a smoke out of it before she
was caught in the act.
January 13 Tuesday 1874
Polly very queer with face ache & all sorts of other aches. I should have
mentioned that yesterday Polly took Sissy, Dotty, Walter & Godfrey to the
States School at the West of Melbourne under charge of Major Parnell,
Harry?s old master. Harry & the little boys would have gone also but they
have to stay at home being suffering from ringworm.
Polly gave a very good account of the appearance of the children & was
particularly pleased at finding Miss Gamble, who had been our little girl?s
teacher at St James & who is now head teacher at the West Melbourne
School, was very glad indeed to see Sissy & Dotty & welcome them cordially
saying how pleased she was to see some of her old pupils back again.
I stayed up very late to-night reading Thackeray?s scraps contributed in the
olden days to Punch & Frazer?s Magazine. Some of them interested me very
much though I was reading under difficulties for the book was one that had
been ill used in the Gaol & it frequently happened that when I came to
some particularly interesting point there was a leaf gone & the thread of the
story lost in consequence. Went into the Gaol at twelve o?clock, found the
Warders all keeping good watch. Adams was on the Gate & was very
talkative about one thing & another. He is smart but a difficult man to keep
straight at all times.
January 14 Wednesday 1874
Read some ofThackeray to Mrs Castieau & the youngsters this evening. The
account of Master Augustus?s visit to the pantomime delighted Harry very
much & he could?ent help noticing a great similarity in his own manner with
that of the young gentleman who accompanied Mr Spec to the play. The All
England Cricketers are playing at Warnambool & seem to be doing better.
The Warnambool men went in first but only scored 68. The Englishmen got
140 in their innings but four or five of them made no runs.


January 15 Thursday 1874
In the Gaol as usual this morning. The Mail from England was telegraphed to
Adelaide. Went to the Treasury in the morning & saw Hall, we are certainly not
very much like brothers in law towards each other, of the two however I think
he is the most distant. The weather was very hot & I was rather tired when I
got home. Polly though better than she had been was still far from well & at
tea time did?ent improve her condition by getting into a bad temper, by some
carelessness the milk was spoilt & this raised Polly?s dander. She ?cant abear? her
tea without milk & the servants caught it for causing her the deprivation. I got
my share of the blowing up in consequence of my venturing on a remonstrance
with regard to some statement of Polly?s touching some cold lamb & a great
many of my shortcomings were told much to my discomforture. Fact is Polly
works too hard some times & when she does gets over tired & easily worrited.
Went to the Club after Muster where I played some cribbage with Cox.
The Club-room has lately been very poorly attended.
This afternoon I attended with Dr McCrea a flogging on a miserable wretch
who had been amusing himself at Geelong by indecently exposing himself to
children. The flogger, Andrews, now under the name of Gately is again a
prisoner in the Gaol having been sentenced for Vagrancy. He is reported to
have been living with some abandoned women somewhat after the style of his
predecessor Bamford who used to herd with two or three of both sexes in some
wretched shelter place in the neighbourhood of the Police Barracks. Andrews
at any rate returned to Gaol with an attack of Gonnorhea for which he was
treated by Dr McCrea with confinement in Cell & low diet. The fellow
grumbled sorely at this but when he was told of the ?job? for this afternoon,
he brightened at once & professed himself as ready. His sickness & his want
of food did?ent save the man he operated on from getting a severe hiding.
January 17 Saturday 1874
Did?ent get much sleep before I got up. Felt in fact rather more tired than
when I went to bed. The sky was cloudy from daylight & we got a little rain
before eleven o?clock.
Polly suffering very much from indigestion. She has been lately quite a
martyr to it. Sent away a letter that arrived by the Mail for Edwin Smith. It
was delivered last night & there was no other for anyone else. I stayed in the
Gaol all the day & then when I found my presence was not required I took
my umbrella & went through the rain, which was then pouring heavily, as far
as the Club.
Met Keeley there & had a chat about old times & especially concerning
theatricals in London in 1851.
Afterwards Britton & I played Amsinck & Keeley Cribbage. The play was
tolerably even. Amsinck was the first to leave & Blackburn came in. Keeley
& I played Britton & Blackburn. In the evening Polly had plucked up


considerably and as the weather had improved she was anxious to go out for
a walk so as in duty bound I accompanied her. We went through Burke Street
& had a look at the Eastern Market. It was dreary in the extreme. There were
scarcely any vegetables & consequently scarcely any people. Polly wanted a
duck but upon reflection she considered the money that such a creature
would cost would be better spent in Chatterbox, so she bought that for the
youngsters instead. When we got home the children who had gone to bed
sniffed the Chatterbox & came trooping down to see it. Their eager
countenances gathered round mamma with the New Book would have made
a good picture if there had only happened to have been a good Artist to have
caught the idea & sketched them as well as their long nightgowns & bare
feet. Marcus Clarke commenced in this day?s Weekly Times a series of articles
under the title of ?The Wicked World? or Melbourne Men & Melbourne
Life. 242 The Article to-day described Camomile or Collins Street. Marcus has
set himself a difficult task. He will have either to be very personal & so make
enemies or be dull & considered commonplace. He might if he were mean
enough perhaps make his subject the vehicle for advertisers. If his work is
read many would pay to have their establishments even appear wicked in it.
January 20 Tuesday 1874
One of the Warders, Lawlor, came on duty this morning the worse for drink
& was reported by Chief Warder Rowley. I saw him at nine o?clock & found
him unsteady so 1 sent him home to get right & return by two o?clock. He
did?ent come back till half past two & was not all right even then, in fact he
was rather worse than he had appeared to be at nine o?clock. I told him to go
home till the morning & then he went & wrote out his resignation. I refused
to accept it until the next day when he would have had time to fully consider
what he was doing & sent him away telling him that if he chose to return at
six o?clock the next morning I would receive him leaving him of course to be
dealt with for his misconduct by the Inspector General. He went away saying
that he would rather resign than have to appear before Mr Duncan.
January 25 Sunday 1874
Very Lazy this morning & did not make any attempt at going to Church.
Polly did not go either, the children were however away in good time.
Yesterday I made up my mind that it was running too great a risk to keep
Ellen Tighe as a servant. She is under sentence of 12 years & though I feel
sure that she would not run away yet I could not help being anxious knowing
well that if she did I could not justify giving her the chance of making her
escape. Polly agreed that I was right & Ellen went in, some one else taking
her place.
242 Marcus Clarke, A Colonial City: High and Low Life: Selected Journalism of Marcus Clarke,
pp. 30Iff. (The first title is correct).


There were two men flogged yesterday morning. One was a China-man, he
came out smiling & putting his hand to his hat in the most obsequious
manner. He pulled off his shirt & put himself into position in almost no
time. During the first part of his punishment he danced a good deal but
when he had received about 10 lashes his head fell forward & he did?ent
move until he had got his number of lashes, 20. He was so still that 1 thought
he had fainted but he was all right & when he was cut down & had to pass
Dr McCrea & myself, he touched his hat again & in a manner as if to thank
us for some great favor we had done him. The second man who was flogged
was a European sentenced for tampering with a child under the age of ten
years. This fellow howled so loud that he could have been heard all over the
Gaol & must have been also by people in or about the Court Houses. When
the doctor had gone, Gately the Flogger who is under the doctor?s hands for
gonnorhea & no nicer looking for his illness, asked me if I had been satisfied
with the way he had done his work. I told him he had done very well & then
he begged for a piece of?backer? ?not to smoke?, ?only to chaw?. I told Rowley
he might give him a fig.
February 4 Wednesday 1874
At the Court part of the time. Mr Ass, one of the Audit Commissioners, was
here at eleven o?clock. He was very brusque in his manner but after all very
kind. The books were tolerably correct but the Commissioner did?ent go half
through them & for one thing did not look at the Stores at all. This was a
terribly dusty day. I was at the Court till nearly six o?clock. In the evening I
went to the Club. There I met Semple & walked away with him. He came to
our house & Polly began to bully me for going away from her when I had
taken her to the Fitzroy Gardens some two or three weeks since. I went away
with Semple, Jardine Smith & Keeley. Polly spit out her feelings in the matter
& made me very cross. I was particularly annoyed and told her so, that in
argument she would never allow the person she was talking to to have a reply,
always contradicting and going on with the talk so soon as any one else began
to speak. Polly cannot help doing this & to night as she indulged in a great
deal of plain speaking & washed a lot of dirty clothes in Semple?s presence I
foolishly gave way to my feelings & spoke out openly too. Semple stayed till
late, we smoked & drank more than was good for us.
February 6 Friday 1874
In the Court in the morning. Very busy afterwards in the office. The Mail
was telegraphed to Adelaide. Mustered in the afternoon.
After Muster went into the playground. The children & some young lads
of the name of O?Connor were playing at pantomime. As soon as I entered
with Mrs Castieau we were received as the Governor & his lady & ?God Save
the Queen? after a style was struck up. Of course we bowed gracefully before


taking our seats. Harry & Master O?Connor then came forward & delivered
the following address
With great suspence you [left blank]
Then there was a retiring behind the green curtain & a lifting up of another
curtain to disclose baby, Johnny, Godfrey & Walter crowned with laurels & in
striking positions. Baby & Johnny were evidently fully impressed with their
importance & were still as still could be. Again there was a rustle of curtains &
down once more went the scene; like lightning it rose again to display the
Union Jack, which as the flag of Old England was greeted with hot applause.
Then the flag slowly raised itself & waved aloft over the heads of the whole of
the Company formed into another tableaux. When the curtain fell again, the
performance was at an end. In the evening I went to the Yorick & read quietly
for a time. Keeley was writing so I did?ent bother him. Walked up Bourke
Street & bought some coffee for Mrs Castieau then came home & got off as
soon as I could to bed.
February 7 Saturday 1874
Up in good time & just soon enough to enable me to take a glimpse at the
letters before going off to the Court to attend the sentencing of a large number
of prisoners convicted during the present Sessions. There were nearly twenty on
whom judgment was pronounced. A number of these were quite young men
but very few of whom had not been previously convicted. In fact it seems that
in the majority of cases after a young fellow has had the prison stamped upon
him once, there is little chance for him hereafter. This is such a gossiping place.
There are so many detective & other police to look after an old gaol bird that
his disgrace is almost sure to make him an outcast from decent society & to
drive him to take refuge with the dissolute & to form part of the flock from
which the police gather their harvest of fresh cases for each court. One young
fellow sent in a statement quietly & apparently openly worded; he declared that
he had been tempted by a young man he knew to take part in a burglary, that
after some persuasion he had been contented to do so & that a third party was
also taken as a mate. When the robbery was coming off, the instigator of the
whole affair suddenly cried out nit, nit, nit & took to his heels, then
immediately several detectives appeared on the scene & arrested the other two
red-handed with the plunder in their possession. Now, said the prisoner in his
statement, I am certain the young man who persuaded us to join him was in
the pay of the Police, that the detectives knew of the robbery & the details of
it & that we were led to commit the theft just to enable the officers to gain
credit by our capture. I am guilty, I admit continued the statement maker but
I think it is very hard that the man who tempted us into crime & then sold us
should be allowed to escape to entrap fresh victims for his detective employers.


This statement was duly sent by me to the Police & the truth of it indignantly
denied. The whole narrative in the opinion of the Crown Prosecutor & the
Judge was a spiteful attempt at injuring the officers & showed what a hardened
villain the man must be who would disparage the zeal & energy of the detectives
& meanly endeavour to deprive them of their well earned exertions & attribute
their success to the trickery of the planner of the burglary, himself in their pay.
Query, if the officers knew a house was to be broken open & did not prevent
the breaking were they not something like accessories?
I was fidgetty to-day for I had a great deal to do & the charge was heavy. I
went to the Police Court as soon as I could after the prisoners were sent back
to the Gaol from the General Sessions. After a little difficulty I found Mr
Sturt & told him my business which was to this effect. A woman had come
into the Gaol two or three times lately & on each occasion had brought in
with her a puny infant; the mother when brought in was suffering from
heavy fits of drunkenness & on each time she came in brought the child in a
still more emaciated condition. At the doctors desire
February 8 Sunday 1874 [i.e. Saturday contd]
the child was taken away & put into the Gaol hospital where it was nourished
with a bottle. The poor little thing seemed however to gradually wither
though every care was bestowed upon it. The mother?s time for discharge
came round to-day but Dr McCrea gave me a certificate to the effect that if
the child was given up to the mother its death would be a certainty as she
could not be trusted to look properly after it. Upon this I tried to get the baby
into the Hospital, but got a polite intimation that the Immigrants home was
the proper place for it. I tried the Immigrants Home & Mr Greig sent me
word that there was no accommodation in his Institution, but that the fitting
place for an infant was the Industrial School. The poor little youngster was
not of course handed about in this way from post to pillar, it was all the while
being nursed in the Gaol. As I said I went to Mr Sturt and after I had told
my story he gave me a mandate for the child?s admission to the Industrial
School. The mother got out this afternoon & wanted to take the child saying
she did?ent dare go home without it. I expected she would want it & that is
why 1 protected myself with the warrant for the school. 1 refused of course to
give up the child but let the mother see it before she went away. The mother
was a young woman, very decent looking, with a husband comfortably off.
She gives way however to the most degraded intoxication & then her infant
was barbarously though probably unconsciously cruelly neglected.
February 9 Monday 1874
Mrs Gee reported that the little neglected one had died this morning. I gave
notice to Dr McCrea & he referred the matter to the Coroner who directed
an Inquest for this afternoon.


This morning when the cell of a woman named McGrath was opened she
appeared to be the same as usual & no particular notice of her was taken; she
was under medical treatment & entitled to be in bed. About an hour after,
the woman?s breakfast was brought to her when to the astonishment of the
attendants she was found to be sitting up in bed nursing a fine baby;
according to her own account she had been confined at about one o?clock but
had not thought it worth while calling out. When asked why she had not
spoken the first time when her cell was opened she replied that the child was
asleep. This woman has been strange in her manner & not considered to be
quite right, her being pregnant was not suspected by the officers, the
prisoners, or the doctor. Dr McGauran came as soon as the birth could be
announced to him & went away saying that the woman was all right.
Received a letter from Mrs Smith, forwarded one to Edwin Smith which
had come in it. Miss McDermott had her dinner with us. There is some
excitement over at the Morphys; they intend leaving in a few days time &
removing to Jolimont. There is a great deal of cackling going on among the
women as to what is best to be done about the furniture. Polly went to see
the new House to-day and is very anxious to help Mrs Morphy if she can.
At three o?clock this afternoon an Inquest was held upon the baby. I was
examined simply upon dates at which the mother came in & went out of
Gaol. Dr McCrea gave the medical evidence & certified that the cause of
Death had been disease of the brain brought on by insufficient food & great
neglect by the mother. A constable gave evidence to the effect that the
neighbours testified to the mother being very kind to the child & the father
said she certainly was so when sober but could not be kept from drink. There
was a sentence of six months in default of Finding Sureties given to the
woman for an assault & I taxed the husband with it. He said however, she
had not assaulted him & he knew nothing about it. I had the warrant hunted
up & to my astonishment found that it was for assault & threatening the life
of the very infant now lying dead. She remained in Gaol on this occasion for
about 3 weeks & the husband then bailed her out. The verdict was in
accordance with the medical evidence & a warrant was issued by the Coroner
committing the woman for Trial on a charge of manslaughter.
Mustered & started to go to the Club, had been working so hard one way
& another throughout the day that I felt tired & came back again.
Attended in the evening a meeting of the Parishioners of St John?s. 243 The
trustees & the Bishops Council seem to be at variance with one another on
the subject of the building of a new church. The Trustees want a new
structure, the Bishops Council express the opinion that the church only
wants a few hundred pounds spent in repairs & that St John?s Parish out of
its surplus income should assist the Church General fund. A resolution was
243 One of the two churches attended by Castieau since the 1830s. The other was St Paul's.


put into my hand, proposing a deputation to wait upon the Bishop &
endeavour to induce him to change the opinion he had expressed. I tried to
stop till the end of the meeting but could not manage it so made my exit as
quietly as I could.
February 17 Tuesday 1874
Very busy in the office, went to the Court, but had to return to send away
nineteen prisoners to Pentridge. The Police only wanted to take a portion of
the men but I objected & after some consideration got a cab to hold those
who were left after the van was filled. Gave evidence at the Court in a Case
where two women were charged with a brothel robbery, one of the women as
soon as she got her share of the plunder came up to the Gaol to pay the fine
for her 'Fancy man?. There was no doubt of the women having got the money
but the Judge seemed to think it served the loser right & summed up in the
prisoners favor. They were acquitted.
Dr McCrea showed me some correspondence he had received from the
Chief Secretary?s office about the rations for short sentenced labor prisoners.
I had with great trouble got the scale altered when Mr Duffy was Chief
Secretary. Mr Duncan took advantage of a paragraph that appeared in The
Age some short time since in which it was reported that two larrikins had
asked for Labor instead of imprisonment only because of the rations being
good & the labor nominal. Without saying a word to me Mr Duncan sent
this paragraph to the Chief Secretary giving it as a reason for altering the
rations to the old scale again. The matter has been referred to Dr McCrea
who Duncan knows is given to starving people & so I happened to see the
correspondence. It seems to me that Messrs Duncan & Snelling are cold
bloodedly endeavouring to ruin me. The Gaol, spite of all they have done or
tried to do gets on better than Pentridge & this galls them. Oh that I only
was cold blooded enough to fight them with the weapons they use which are
deceit & selfishness. I am not such a fool however after all to wish so far as
that. It is better for me to be hot & hasty & show my hand than to be guilty
of the meannesses they indulge in, meannesses that could only have been
brought to perfection in the old Hand School at which the pair of them
graduated. I shall blaze over I know soon & then I will let the Chief Secretary
know a little more about the Department than he does at present.
February 25 Wednesday 1874
In the Gaol at usual hour. Polly rather better to-day & went to Elsternwick
in the morning for a change. She called at Cowderoy?s & had dinner at
Dotty?s house, she got home by tea time. I went to the Club in the evening
but did not stay late. Duerdin walked up Bourke Street with me. At the
Eastern Market I saw some tempting looking tomatoes marked at a penny
per pound & I bought six penny worth; at the same stall there were some


larger tomatoes at 2d [tuppence]. With the exception of their size they did
not appear any better than those I purchased & I asked why they were so
much more expensive. The dealer replied, he supposed it was because some
people thought they could?ent be good at Id & would rather pay 2d. Upon
my word I believe he was speaking the truth. The man said that he had
frequently sold apples of similar quality some at 3d & others at 6d, the
sixpenny ones being wiped up a bit. It?s a rum world my masters & I do not
doubt the truth of what my seller of tomatoes told me. A white hat in Bourke
Street costs 15/-, the same sort of one in every respect is charged a guinea for
in Collins Street. One street is however a fashionable & the other but a
business one.
March 11 Wednesday 1874
In the Gaol office as usual, spent a very quiet day & mustered at the proper
time. Went to the Club where I played some cribbage with Wyatt &
McKinley, came away with Semple & got home by tea time. In the evening
as the weather was very warm Harry, myself & Mamma were sitting together
outside in the fresh air, when Master Harry proposed that we should sing one
after the other, the first breaking down to suffer a penalty. We sang away at a
great rate Harry showing some little knowledge of music, Mamma singing
like an angel & I boldly as a lion. When we were tired of singing we went
into the house & did some Shakespearian Readings. Harry & I read the
Grave-diggers. Harry read the Ist Gravedigger very well. Afterwards Polly &
I did Pericles & Catherine in The Taming of the Shrew. This amused us very
well & brought on ten o?clock. Then Polly & I had our toddy & then I got
in real life a lesson of how absurd the Play was we had been reading & how
false it was to nature for my Katherina gave me a lecture & shut me up in
very quick time. Money & how we were to get over our difficulties was the
burden of our talk. Polly gave it to me hot & I suppose that I deserved it.
March 12 Thursday 1874
Have let my Diary run on for three or four days without attending to it &
consequendy shall have some difficulty in making it all right again. Went to the
Club after Muster. Polly had made an arrangement to go to the theatre with Joe
& Emma, neither of them however came to the Gaol according to promise &
Polly went away with Godfrey. Received a communication from the Crown
Law Officer asking me to get a statement from a man named Richardson who
had been convicted of rape & against whom sentence of Death had been
recorded. I took the statement & sent it up to Harriman.
It was a queer story the man told but I believe he spoke the truth to a great
extent & that there never was any rape committed, nothing at any rate it
seemed had been said about it by the woman till about fourteen days after the
man had connexion with her & then because she was suffering from gonnorhea


& had afflicted her husband likewise. Stayed at home drinking & smoking &
doing a little reading till Polly returned with Godfrey from the theatre at twelve
o?clock. Godfrey would stay till the end. Polly still very queer & suffering a
great deal of pain; the remedies she takes for her liver do not appear to do her
any good & I think it must be worry & over exertion that is making her ill &
keeping her from getting well.
March 13 Friday 1874
This morning Williams came up from the Age office & read me what he had
written with regard to the Gaol. I went into town with him & McKinley.
Completed a statement that Richardson made to me & sent it to Harriman,
who sent me a nice note this morning. In the afternoon Mr Duncan came to
the office & we had very much like a row. I said something about the Gaol
not being in such good order now as it was before the amalgamation with the
Penal Department & this riled the Inspector & we went on till things looked
very unpleasantly. The Inspector after a time began to try and smooth
matters down, he said he did not intend the Memo, relative to the money to
annoy me but simply to enable me to warn my clerks about the necessity
there was for being particularly careful with the accounts. He wished that i
would not take official matters so much to heart & not take everything that
was written as intended to give me annoyance. I went on a great deal more
than I ought about Snelling & I am afraid made matters a great deal worse
instead of better. In the evening I went to the Club where I played some
cribbage. Received a Telegram from Darvall telling me he would be at the
train this evening, went to the Railway Station to meet him but just missed
him. Returned to the house where Darvall had just arrived. After a long talk
went off to bed.
March 24 Tuesday 1874
Stephen the Attorney General. I have scarcely ever seen him without a wig &
did?ent know him when he came into the train. I daresay he thought me a
sulky ill-tempered brute for not bowing to him &C I am sure I am very sorry
that I did?ent. I could have had I believe a very nice little chat with Mr
Stephen as he rode all the way to Elsternwick &C got out when I did. I am not
in form &c have just now a streak of devil?s own luck, that?s very certain. Will
things get better I wonder?
As soon as I left the Station I made directly for the Beach & after a rather
tiring walk across the shingle came upon Polly & the children. They did not
see me till I was close upon them. Polly was barefooted, dancing in the sand
while the children were playing jollily near her. They were delighted to see
me & I never had any idea of the relief that Polly could feel at being away
from the cares of her household. She was apparently as happy as a child & as
contented as possible with the shadiest of accommodation so long as she was


allowed to rest her mind. So far as her body went she evidently was not
resting that & did not find it tired either. I went into the bathing box &
arrayed myself in Polly?s dressing gown, then took a bath as well as I could
with the novel encumbrance of the gown. The dip did me good.
Aunty Dotty & her youngsters came down to the Beach & had a little
romp with us, then Polly & I went home to tea. Polly put the children to bed
& then walked as far as the Village Belle with me. 244 I went back some
distance with her & then went to St Kilda, came to Melbourne by Train &
got home sometime before nine o?clock.
April 1 Wednesday 1874
Great pain in my chest & severe cold in my head. The General Sessions
commenced, I went at ten o?clock & remained till nearly twelve in order to
see the business fairly started. Quin being away on Sick Leave Fiddimont had
to take his place at the Court. Mustered in the afternoon & then went to the
Club, stayed talking for some time & then walked away with Duerdin. When
I got home I found Polly in a rather excited condition. A servant she got in
yesterday & who she thought would suit her capitally had given herself airs
& refused to do the ordinary work allotted to her situation. Polly sent her
back to the Gaol in disgust. There have been two or three servants lately
who have behaved in somewhat similar a manner & I shall have to take this
one in hand myself & show the rest through her that the work of my
house will have to be done as regularly & correctly as any other work of
the establishment.
To night Annie Forman was with our children & after they had had a game
or two of bagatelle & drafts, they settled down in the parlor & Mamma,
Harry & myself read a scene or two from Shakspeare. Harry was particularly
delighted with the Witches Chorus in Macbeth & would insist upon his
audience encoring him in it. To please him we duly went over it with him
again. Polly, Harry & I then read the Trial Scene in Othello, Polly taking
Desdemona & Harry Brabantio, leaving Othello for your humble servant.
April 3 Friday 1874
Good Friday. Bad cough & cold yet. Hot Cross buns in the usual style.
Macnee sent or rather brought Mrs Castieau a fine bunch of flowers.
I attended in my office, did a little business & then made up my Diary. In
the afternoon went to the Club, where I played some cribbage, came home
to tea. Miss Watson, Mrs Zincke, Mrs Dalziel & Jenny went with Polly in the
evening to hear the Opera of Moses in Egypt. They were rather disappointed
for instead of the dramatic version of the Opera which they expected to see,
the performers appeared only in private dress & simply sang the music.
244 Polly had obviously taken the children on a seaside holiday, while Castieau remained in town.


I took it into my head to-day that as things were looking desperate with me
I had better do something desperate, so I sent a letter to the Chief Secretary
in which I asked him to give me my promotion telling him how hard up I
was & how my difficulties had come about. I addressed it to him as a private
letter & directed it to his residence. Mrs Zincke & her brother were at our
house this evening.
April 11 Saturday 1874
In the Office as usual & worked hard there until about one o?clock. At half
past one Polly & I started off to the University where we were invited to attend
the opening ceremony of the Session & see the takers of Degrees presented to
the Chancellor. There was a great crowd we found had arrived before us & we
were obliged to content ourselves with standing on a table in a side room
which had windows looking into the main building; the windows were open
& we could see & be seen very well. As the weather was exceedingly hot & the
Hall only canvas while our roof was a permanent one, we had rather the best
of it as we were not nearly so much incommoded with the heat as those who
had got the good places.
Agnes Lotherington 245 was with the Stephen family &of course the
Attorney General?s party was in a place of honor. The Chancellor Sir
Redmond Barry was gorgeous & only a little less so was the Vice Chancellor
Dr Brownless. The Dean, Professor Hearn, was resplendent in scarlet, the
chairs provided for the Chancellor & Vice were as bright as gilt could make
them. The Chancellor?s seat was the more throne like, but on each side of it
was a chair that looked grand enough for an emperor. There was a little fuss
made & the Governor was announced; he took his seat in one of the chairs by
the side of the Chancellor. The presentations were then made, but just as the
last man was presented the Governor, escorted by the Vice Chancellor left the
room. In two or three minutes he returned wearing a scarf showing the Degree
he had taken, entitled to it as he was by his English University education.
There was much cheering when the Governor bowed to the Chancellor &
when that magnificent individual graciously lifted his plumed cap in return.
Sir George made a speech & so did Sir Redmond & then all was over. Take it
altogether the ceremony was interesting & amusing. Mr Frank Duffy 246
obtained the first prize for an Essay on the discovery of Australia & was called
up to read it. The young gentleman seemed to have plenty of confidence &
got on very well. As he saw that the crowd did not want to listen however good
his composition was, he skipped over page after page amid loud laughter from
the assembled students. The reader at last stopped & bowing said, ?well
gentlemen I really did?ent expect to furnish you with so much amusement?.
245 Castieau?s niece, daughter of Emma, 19 years of age at this time.
246 Frank Gavan Duffy (1852-1936), later a brilliant advocate and, at the end of his life, Chief
Justice of the High Court of Australia (1931-36).


When Frank Duffy left the presence of the Chancellor he was warmly greeted
& appears to be a general favorite; he has a good chance of making a good
position for himself with his father?s name & his own talents combined.
April 13 Monday 1874
Began in the office as usual & was tolerably busy all the morning. In the
afternoon Jenny came in; she went with Polly into town purchasing various
articles & returned to tea. I went to a meeting of the Committee of the
Dischd. Prs. Aid Society & found quite a large attendance. Judge Pohlman
was in the Chair & Mr Duncan amongst the other Committee men. I walked
up the street with the Judge & was very much amused with the set made
upon him by the Newspaper Boys. He gives 3d for his penny Herald & is
spotted as soon as he shows in the street after the publication of the ?Evening
Thunderer?. The Judge did not get into Mullens? Library 247 before he had had
to give another urchin 3d; the lad worked upon his feelings in some way or
another & went away grinning at his good luck.
I called in at the Club & walked home with Jardine Smith. Jenny had a bad
cold but for all that she plucked up strength enough to go to the theatre. Mrs
Zincke also went with us. Mr John Dunn kindly sent me an order for a
gentleman & party of ladies so that outside the usual expences of moving
about we were not much out of pocket. Moving expences however are not to
be sneered at. There were to-night 1/6 for lollies, 6d for ginger-beer,
sixpences for cloak room so far as Polly and myself were concerned. Mrs
Darvall & Mrs Zincke they had their Travelling Expences. The Palace of
Truth was played & after it a mad piece of absurdity called The Wedding
March. This was the most outrageously ridiculous & nonsensical piece I have
ever seen & it made us all laugh heartily; it was however rather too long &
the third Act could be very well dispensed with. I took Jenny down to the
Railway Station as soon as we had started off Mrs Zincke to Simpsons Road
by a cab. At the Station we met Mr Berry & in his care we left Jenny. Got
home by twelve o?clock & to bed before one o?clock. Polly went with Jenny
to-day to see the Bilsons.
April 17 Friday 1874
At Court this morning but left it to get on with my work as soon as I could.
There was plenty to do in the Gaol. In the afternoon I went again to the
Court where a prisoner named [blank space] was being tried for rape on his
step child, a girl of eleven years of age. According to the child?s testimony, the
offence was committed in a right of way of Little Bourke Street on a Saturday
night after ten o?clock. The child said she did not scream because her father
put his hand over her mouth & she was also frightened that if she made any
noise her father would murder her. She told no one of what had happened
247 A fashionable lending library in Collins Street.


till some time after the occurrence. The Judge summed up greatly in favor of
the prisoner, putting it to the Jury, whether it was probable a man would have
attempted such a crime in such a place when he must have been aware that
he was liable to be intruded on at any moment as there were sure to be
numbers of people about at the time, especially in the locality where the
offence was sworn to have been committed. The Jury found the prisoner
Guilty & he was sentenced to Death.
Went to the Club where I played three or four games of cribbage with
McKinley & Short. When I got home I found that Polly had gone out to
meet me so in common politeness I went after her, taking Godfrey & Walter
with me. We met Polly & Harry in Swanston Street.
Received yesterday a letter from Mr King of Adelaide stating that he had
sent me a case of grapes & telling me where to get them sent, but by some
mistake the grapes were not received. Wrote to Mr King & told him so. All
this day I have felt fitty symptoms & was afraid to be about; it is a most
wretched supernatural kind of feeling & makes me very uncomfortable.
Began taking Hydrate of Potassium again. 248
April 18 Saturday 1874
In Gaol nearly the whole of the day & mustered in the afternoon.
After Muster went to the Club. Left with Semple. Met Marcus Clarke in
Swanston Street, & undertook to stamp & post a letter for him. Had nearly
got home when Polly & some of the youngsters came to meet me. Went to
bed tolerably early.
Mr Coppin called to see me this afternoon with reference to my Vote for
the Assembly. I did not make any promise but was very civil. Polly had got
hold of Coppin before I came in & evidently would have promised him a
hundred votes if she had had them to give.
Polly received a letter from Jenny. She had reached home all right & was
evidently delighted at being in her own place again. In her letter she went
into raptures at the cleanliness & comfort of her house; no doubt Fanny
deserves a good deal of credit for having looked so well after things in the
absence of her mother. 249
The bromide of potassium I have been taking for this last day or two seems to
have shut out the phantoms that were busy whispering into my brain & figuring
before my eyes. I feel it is lucky for me I had such a remedy for tis certain without
it or some other as powerful I should have had another illness; as it is, I feel
subdued but not sick & trust to get again all right. The Newspapers are full of
election proceedings & there will be apparently in the neighbourhood of
Melbourne some keen contests. The Ministry will however have the best of the
fight & will be able to claim a victory when the battle has terminated.
248 Presumably as an alkaline agent.
249 Refers to Polly?s sisters return to her family in Beechworth. Fanny was her eldest child, then 16 years.


April 19 Sunday 1874
Took it out in bed this morning & did not get up till after nine o?clock, went
for a little walk towards the cemetary with Polly & Harry. Polly was not very
well & fancied a walk instead of going to Church, the little girls & Walter &
Godfrey went to Church. I did not go very far with Polly but soon returned
to take charge of the house, met Dr Robertson & at his invitation went into
his house with him, had a chat for some time principally upon the subject of
the elections. Dr Robertson remarked that with regard to Mr Hearn the
Dean of Faculty, he should be glad to hear of his being relegated back to his
duties in the University. It seems that his being enabled to come forward was
a dodge, the bye-laws of the University prohibiting the Professors from
Sitting in Parliament. Professor Hearn?s friends were siezed with a brilliant
idea & made him a Dean with all the privileges & responsibilities of a
Professor; the change of name had this advantage that Deans were not
prohibited from interfering in politics & so Mr Hearn?s candidature. 250
In the afternoon I went to Kew & had tea with Kerferd. Mrs Kerferd had
only returned from Sorrento the day previous & so there was a little
confusion in the house. I was however very hospitably entertained. In the
course of the evening Mr Kerferd told me that the Board appointed to
consider the claims of the relatives of deceased officers had recommended
that Mrs Wintle should receive �9OO. This is a heavy lump & is supposed to
be in consequence of Mr Wintle?s special duties & of the onerous
responsibilities he had in the early days of the Colony. I imagine also the
injustice that was done him was taken into consideration of only allowing
him pension on his salary & not giving him any thing in lieu of his Quarters
&c. Met Dempster & Winch at Hawthorn Station, saw Mr & Mrs Ellis in
the Bus coming to Carlton.
May 3 Sunday 1874
Came into the office this afternoon & wrote up my Diary which of course has
been neglected altogether during the past week. 251 In the evening felt a little
inclination to be out & when I hinted at going for a little while Polly began to
think that she would like a change as well. I took her to the Post Office & put
her in a cab that would take her near to Mrs Smith?s house, then I went off to
the Club where I saw McKinley, Harrison & Amsinck. Williams came in
afterwards & I took him to the other room & spoke to him about the article
on the Gaol in Saturday?s Age & which I knew he must have written. He told
me that the article was a very different one from that he sent in. The Editor
told him he was surprised at receiving such an article as the paper had always

to pass a statute prohibiting professors standing for parliamentary election (Australian Dictionary

gone the other way. Williams was therefore obliged to take his article & cut it
another way & that was a way as unfavorable for the Gaol as could be. Williams
acquainted me that he had been at Pentridge & that he was not at all well
impressed with it. He said he was going to-day to see Duncan & to ask him for
the information about Pentridge that 1 had given about the Gaol. Williams will
unless he is thoroughly false give Pentridge worse than he has given the Gaol;
very likely however this will not suit the Editor & I shall not be surprised
whatever may be said. Facts are evidently of no consequence.
May 5 Tuesday 1874
Have not quite recovered & although I was about the Gaol the whole day felt
weak & out of sorts. Mr Curtain M.P., Mr Pidgeon T.C. & Mr Corcoran
Licensed Victualler, all of whom are anxious to pull down the Gaol or rather
that it should be pulled down, paid me a visit this afternoon & I went with
them through the buildings & showed them what a lot they wanted to
destroy. According to their practical ideas, the pulling down & the re-
construction of the Gaol somewhere else would be only a trifling matter &
the expense of the work not worth consideration when the value of the land
the present Gaol now stands on was taken into account. Mr Duncan came
before the Visitors left.
I received two memos., one calling me to account for my absence. Duncan
knew perfectly well that I had been sick, the other with regard to the Article
in The Age & asking whether the tone of the article was derived from me &
whether I had made the statements that were in it. Duncan & I went at it
hammer & tongs this afternoon. First of all I pointed out how unnecessary it
was to send the memo, about my absence when he, Mr Duncan, knew
perfectly well that I had had to lie up. Dr McCrea came in then & I got a
certificate from him, the doctor grumbled out ?that I had not been absent?.
Mr Duncan & I talked, according to him I had been an obstructive & had
not taken things quietly like I ought to have done. I retaliated by saying that
ever since I had made an admission that it was intended to make me Deputy,
Mr Duncan had turned against me & that I was looked upon as a black sheep
& that the object was to get rid of me. I pointed out that I considered
Snelling had a down upon me because I would not consider him as a superior
& I said I could not look up to him as a superior either from experience or
antecedents. The latter word Duncan did not seem to like. The I. General
then began to talk of what he had done for me & instanced the case of
Warder Meadway. I pointed out to him that this man had been charged by
me with Neglect of Duty & Undue Familiarity with a prisoner & that he had
acquitted him of the latter charge although I had distinctly proven it. Mr
Duncan would?ent believe this for some time & insisted on seeing the record.
I showed it to him & then he began to remember that the ?undue familiarity?
was not proven. I told Mr Duncan that I looked upon the present attack
upon me as being in consequence of the estimates coming forward & said


that I had the strongest hopes of being promoted as I was sure the Chief
Secretary was favorably disposed towards me. Duncan?s jaw fell; he could not
support my promotion unless the Superintendent at Pentridge was promoted
also. He considered the offices were on a par. Sometime ago Mr Duncan told
me he did?ent know what Mr Gardner was wanted for. I said I knew nothing
about the Superintendent & did?ent care who was promoted so long as I was.
Went to the Club, read in the evening & went to bed early.
May 6 Wednesday 1874
In the office early, answered the memos sent me yesterday. The weather
changed to wet, Polly however went away to Emma?s. G.C. Levey who has
been home to England called to see me. This morning David Blair had
another Leader in The Argus on the Gaol & made it out to be terribly
crowded with an idle population. I got Levey to walk through & he said it
was as well conducted a Gaol as he had been in in England & that he had?ent
seen anywhere a work room like the one in which our women are employed
sewing, nor a lot of women conducting themselves in a more orderly manner.
Mustered in the afternoon & then went to the Club where I played three
games of cribbage. Wheeler was my partner & we played against Judge Cope
& Mr Wyatt the Police Magistrate. Polly had arrived home before I got back
from the Club; she had been to Mrs Elliot?s as well as to Mrs Lotherington?s.
May 7 Thursday 1874
Busy in the Office all day though I called at the Sheriff?s Office in the
morning. There was a great letter in The Age from Curtain & a leading article
both advocating the removal of the Gaol & making use of the site for a
Central Railway Terminus. There is evidently a ?Ring? formed to carry out
this nice little job & I expect, as the Press seem to be in it, that very likely it
will succeed. The proposed change would no doubt be a good thing for a few
property owners in the neighbourhood.
The Visiting Justice & Mr Call were here in the afternoon. The first Case
gone into was that of a girl in whose possession three half sovereigns were
found. The girl stole the money & swallowed it. While in Gaol she recovered
its possession, but as she would not share the money with another girl who
knew she had it, the latter in revenge told the warders all about it. The money
was ordered to be given to the rightful owner, who will I imagine be rather
astonished at getting his half sovereigns back again. Two or three devils of
women were brought up for Assaults & punished.
Went into town after five o?clock, on the road met Williams of The Age, he
told me that he had seen Francis & that the chief had taken him to task about
the Article on the Gaol & seemed inclined to be angry with me for furnishing
him with the means. Williams said he told Mr Francis that he got very little
information from me but went outside for the most of it. Williams had been


to Pentridge last week & from what he told me is not at all inclined to praise
up that establishment. It seems that he went with one or two other reporters
& got rather cavalier treatment, not seeing either the Superintendent or his
Assistant. They were at last handed on to a Warder, but declined to go with
him & after a little flourishing of the Chief Secretary?s order were taken in
hand by an Officer who I imagine must have been the Chief Warder. Williams
formed no favorable impression of the prison & if he writes as he expressed
the intention of doing will rather astonish the Pentridge people. The Age
however will very probably be placated before the article is published & it
would not astonish me to see a glowing description of the central prison with
a highly eulogistic & circumstantial account of the excellent management &
the very satisfactory amount of work performed, together with the
encouraging moral effects produced upon the prisoners by the deterrent,
though at the same time merciful & impartial discipline in force &c.
At the Club I played three games of cribbage, got home before seven
o?clock. Read in the evening & went to bed at ten o?clock.
May 8 Friday 1874
Had to hear a number of charges against women. One brute after receiving
a sentence used an opprobrious expression towards me & told me I could
now go & f? Mrs Gee. This is not pleasant to put up with in the presence
of a number of female officers.
Mr Gorman asked for Leave; poor fellow, his wife it appears is very ill &
he has two children bad with Typhoid Fever. I recommended his being
allowed to leave at once. His application was granted.
Mustered in the afternoon & then went to the Club, played one game of
cribbage. Got home early but on the road met Polly & some of the children
coming to meet me. Spent a very lazy evening & went to bed early.
The Newspapers are still hammering away at the idea of doing away with
the Gaol. The Evening Herald to night said that several members of the
Cabinet were in favor of the movement & it was generally hoped that the
Government would decide & act at once in the matter.
The woman Jesson that I punished this morning was destructive during the
day & at night towards Muster time, with the view of giving me a treat,
stripped herself stark naked. I did not avail myself however of the
opportunity but contented myself with the knowledge that she was alive &
strong as I could hear her shouting in her cell. She had to be put in a straight
waistcoat later on in the evening. There are about six beasts of women who
it would be really no crime to quietly put out of the world. They are a
nuisance to themselves & an abomination to every one about them. Kindness
has no effect upon these wretches & they seem to glory in the excitement of
punishment. The gag & the whip would perhaps have some effect if such
weapons could be held in terrorem over them.


May 14 Thursday 1874
Mr Evans the Editor of The Argus & Mr Jardine Smith came to the Gaol this
afternoon to make enquiries about the working of the establishment. It
appeared the Chief Secretary had been remonstrating with the Argus people
about the article that Mr Blair had written with regard to the Gaol & the
want of employment in it for the prisoners & the crowd of larrikins it
contained. I went through the buildings with them & was sorry they had
come after Lock-Up time. Jardine Smith is evidently to write a leader on the
Gaol. He is to come to-morrow to get particulars from me about the number
of young fellows between 16 & 20 there are in the Labor Yard. I walked into
Collins Street with Dr Evans & Mr Smith & left them as they passed the
Club. Played some cribbage with Wheeler for a partner & McKinley & Short
for opponents, each side won two games.
May 16 Saturday 1874
The Criminal Sittings continued. I went to the Court but did not stay there
much of the day. In The Argus of this morning was published Jardine Smith?s
Leader on the Gaol. It commenced with an Apology for a previous article
'The Mayor of Melbourne Planting the First Elm in Collins Street'
Reproduced from The Illustrated Australian News , 14 June 1875, p. 81


which had been inserted which the present one acknowledged had been
written on incorrect information. It then pointed out the defects of the Gaol
system owing to want of accommodation & then went on to give credit for
what was done to make the best of things. Altogether the article was a very
favorable one & one judiciously written so as not to tread upon the toes of any
one but David Blair, the writer of the first article that the Editor published.
In the afternoon I went to the Club & played some cribbage. Left once to
learn how things were going on in the Court & on the way met Mr G.P.
Smith. We walked together & had a chat; he looks forward again to office.
He has been spoken with as to the advantages of removing the Gaol &
making a Railway Station on the present site. He strongly advised me to hold
myself in readiness to show how the removal could be effected. While Smith
& I were talking we met Poole the Sub-Editor of The Age & Smith told him
what we had been talking about. Went back to the Club & had a chat with
Semple. Met Edwin Wintle & he joined me. As we walked up Swanston
Street Edwin asked me to cross the road with him & I consented; this was
when we had got as far as the Police Court. While in the road I was talking
with my head turned towards my companion when I ran up against a barrow
that was in the way. It was very dark & neither of us had noticed it. I partly
fell & just then a cab passing by struck my ankle & made me very dizzy. 252 It
was a minute or two before I quite knew what I was about & then I was
careful in getting up for fear my leg was broken. I was very glad when I found
I could feel [?] the ground & use it, although it was not without a great deal
of pain that I was able to do so. My walking stick was broken in the tumble.
I went with Edwin to the Earl of Zetland. Got my clothes brushed & had
some brandy & water then Edwin walked with me as far as the Gaol. It was
very painful for me to use my leg. When I reached home I got Cameron to
look at it, he did not however think there was any necessity of doing more
than to patiently rest it.
May 18 Monday 1874
My leg was very troublesome to-day. Polly however got me a walking stick in
the morning & with this I managed to hobble into the Gaol & do my work
in the office. The Court was going on but I could not go near it. Towards
Muster time I went through the Gaol & saw the Labor men turned in out of
the Yard, spent the evening at home reading, sent to-day newspapers to my
father & a letter to Mrs Smith.
Miss McDermott was with us to-day & gave the usual music lessons. Polly
had to change servants yesterday; while she was at Church she expected the
house would be made tidy & that everything would be correct in the
252 Castieau's accident highilights two of the 'nuisances' of the city?its lack of lighting and its
street obstructions, such as this barrow. See Andrew Brown-May, Melbourne Street Life: The
Itinerary of Our Days (Melbourne, 1998), especially pp. 112-119 and ch. 6.


kitchen on her return, however to her disgust there were no beds made &
things were at sixes & sevens throughout the house. My wife likes her dinner
well cooked & great therefore was her annoyance when that meal was served
to-day to find no gravy had been made for her chicken & that the bird itself
was stuffed with sage instead of the correct seasoning. There was some
grumbling but no action as Polly hoped for the best & was loth to send the
woman who was in fault back to the Gaol. Affairs were at a crisis towards
evening, & sadly complaining that she had not had time to get her dinner,
in went Jessie Robertson.
Went early to bed having a little talk with Rowley before I went off to my
couch & hoping sincerely I should be able to walk about when I got up again.
May 19 Tuesday 1874
During the night I suffered terribly from what I suppose must have been
indigestion. I had a terrible pain all across my back & when I dropped off
asleep soon awoke again almost with a scream from the torture I was
enduring. At last Polly got up & made me a mustard plaster. This did me
good & I should have got an hour or two?s sleep but the boys were wakeful
& rowdy & in consequence their Mamma was kept in & out of bed in the
vain attempt to stop their mass diversions. Got into my office in good time.
Mr Duncan paid me a visit & talked very amicably about things in general.
We spoke of the newspaper articles & Mr Macnee was called into the office
to tell what Mr David Blair had said when he called at the Gaol. Macnee
could?ent say much about it, he had?ent taken notice. Mr Duncan told him
he should have taken notice or referred him to me for information. Mr Sturt
was at the Gaol in the afternoon, he stated that he had spoken to Francis
about me & that Francis had promised to bear what he said in mind. The
warders sent in a grumbling petition asking that all the warders should
perform the same amount of night duty. I was going to answer it all in a
hurry but thought it wiser to think about it before I took any action. Spent
the evening reading with Harry & Sissy; both of these youngsters have some
idea of dramatic reading & like very much to show off their capabilities. Sissy
& I read a scene from the School for Scandal. Harry & I soared higher for we
tried several Shaksperian pieces.
Walter & Godfrey were in disgrace, they were restricted to bread & water
rations & sent to bed as soon as their frugal repast after they came back from
school was finished.
May 20 Wednesday 1874
Parliament opened by the Governor. Tried to get on a boot on to the foot I
injured but found it would not go on as my ankle was still very much
swollen. Had to stay in the office the whole of the day, the greater part of
which however I spent in putting my papers into order. This was a wearisome


task for I had collected such a lot of apparrent rubbish, the most of which
however I felt it was not safe policy to destroy for fear of its being wanted
some day or other. I did clear out some however & so far did good. I must
have another attack to-morrow.
This morning I was very much annoyed with Hackett; he rushed an old
man to my office & charged him with being grossly insolent. Hackett has the
reputation of having had six wives & it appears this is known among the
prisoners. As he was going through the Yard the old man I speak of twitted
him with having killed four women. The old man in extenuation of his
conduct alleged that Hackett had called him a whoremaster the day before.
Witnesses were sent for & it appeared that some of the prisoners it seemed
had said it was a shame that an old man should be charged with Idleness &
that Hackett had replied to them ?that he was not too old to be a
whoremaster?. I asked Hackett if he had made use of any such remark & he
replied ?he did?ent know?, ?He was?ent sure?. I got out of patience with him,
dismissed the charge against the prisoner & told Hackett if he did?ent be
more careful, I would report that he was unfit for his position. It was only
the other day that a prisoner talked of the Overseer playing chequers with the
prisoners instead of looking after them at work.
May 28 Thursday 1874
In the Gaol the whole day. Mr Slack a well known litigant & who acts as his
own attorney gave me notice that he intended bringing an action against me &
others for Assault & Imprisonment. Slack was confined in Gaol on the Sheriff?s
Warrant for a very long time. He threatens his Action against the attorney who
was employed in the Case against him, the Sheriff, the bailiff & myself. I do
not think Mr Slack will do himself much good or us much harm.
In the afternoon I had to go to the Gaol to see some women who had made
a fuss about their rations. I gave one two days solitary for insolence & she was
abusing me most terribly when Mr Duncan came into the Wing. I went with
the Inspector through the Gaol & talked to him about proposed alterations
in the Labor Yard then came to the office & saw a woman who had to
complain of her ration. She lied stiffly enough but got no good by it,
Mrs Gee & myself both asserting that her ration had been a rather better
one than usual.
I showed Mr Duncan the answer I had written to the warders letter about
their night duty, he said he thought ?I had answered them very fairly?.
Went to the Club walking as far as Bourke Street with Miss McDermott
who had been to-day giving the usual music lessons to our children & to
Harry Hall. Poor little Sissy came from School to-day in a bad way. She had
been taken very ill & was obliged to come home sooner than usual. She had
to go to bed & take Diarrhoea mixture.

Played some cribbage with Cox & Harrison, came away from the Club with
Harrison, walked up Bourke Street with him. In the evening played a game of
Bezique with Polly & another with Dotty & went to bed by ten o?clock.
Chaffed Judge Cope to-day about a little boy Mrs Cope has presented him
with. The Copes hav?ent had a baby for some years. I said to the Judge that
he was setting a bad example, that my youngest was five years old & that he
made me feel uncomfortable at the chance of a further increase. The Judge
went off saying all I can tell you is that you are never safe. 253
June 6 Saturday 1874
For some days I have been suffering from very painful corns, they make my
feet so tender that I really have no comfort in walking about. This evening I
stayed at home while Polly went out marketing. She also put my name down
as a Subscriber to the Athenaeum. I have joined that Institution as I shall be
able to get books there & read all the papers and at the same time bring some
books away for home use. The Yorick did not seem to answer for me. I was
constantly making it an expensive place of refuge & was doing myself no
good with having the reputation of being on intimate terms with press
writers. I must say the company that I met at the Yorick was much more to
my taste & that I shall give it up with great reluctance; still I know it will be
prudent for me to do so & that Polly will be very glad for me to content
myself with the Athenaeum & to have no more to do with the Yorick. 254

When I went to bed this evening I felt very far from well & so took a couple
of pills. Polly was very loving & tried hard to make me comfortable. I was
notwithstanding very ungrateful & kicked about a great deal instead of going
to sleep as became me.
June 7 Sunday 1874
Polly took Harry & Dotty to the Roman Catholic Church this morning as
the opera singers were to be in the choir & help celebrate a Grand Mass.
Harry, Godfrey & Walter went to our church. I stayed at home, not thinking
it would be safe to risk the effect of last night?s pills. Had a very hearty dinner
&C then mustered. After Muster went to the Railway Station to start for
Kerferd?s, met Stiles of the Bank of N.S. Wales & had a little chat with him.
Got to Kerferd?s in due course. The Attorney General was in excellent temper
& both he & Mrs Kerferd treated me very kindly. Had a long chat, Kerferd
probing me about my money matters. He advised my going ?home? & I
expressed how much I should like to do so but how impossible it would be
for me to afford to do it. Kerferd said that when the Estimates were brought
forward the Chief Secretary had expressed the intention of restoring me to
the position 1 had lost 2 ? & that no member said a word against his doing so.
I said that I had expected more but of course would be very thankful for even
what I was to receive. Kerferd told me that Duncan had a grievance against
me with regard to a newspaper article & I said that it was very unfair of him
to blame me, that I had only given information I was instructed to do & that
I had nothing to do with the tone in which the article was written.
June 8 Monday 1874
In the Gaol & tolerably busy all the day. Polly went up to see Kerferd with
regard to my going away for the benefit of my health. He was very kind &
promised that if I got a certificate from Dr McCrea that he the Minister
would do all in his power to help get me the Leave I required on full pay.
Polly spoke to Dr McCrea in the afternoon but although he was very kind &C
spoke highly of the good feeling he had towards me he would not he said
recommend my going away on a long voyage because he did not consider it was
what I required. The doctor was most impressive when speaking of the
necessity there was for my entirely giving up the use of all stimulants, he felt
confident he said that total abstinence would be better for me than
moderation. Poor Polly was made very uncomfortable by the doctor & is I fear
in a great way about my state of health. She is a dear good wife & mother.
This afternoon I went to the American Consul?s Chambers to attend a
meeting of the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society; on the way there 1 met
Messrs Poole & Williams of the Age office & went with them into the Town
Hall to see the Portrait of Sir Henry Barkley which has just been received as
255 That is, his demotion in 1873 (see Introduction).


a present to the Corporation from that gentleman. Did not think very much
of the likeness.
At the Meeting transacted a considerable amount of business & was placed
on a Sub Committee appointed to consider the best means of rendering
assistance to Discharged female prisoners. Left the Meeting with Zox. 256
Went to have my hair cut. Got home in time for tea & to receive Harry who
had been to the Athenaeum to get a book changed. Played bagatelle with
Polly & went to bed before ten o?clock.
June 10 Wednesday 1874
Woke suffering great pain all down my left side. The agony I suffered was so
severe that I could not help actually crying out with the pain when
I essayed to move about. As I had a bad head ache as well, I sent for an
emetic; this cleared my stomach of a great quantity of bile & relieved me
somewhat of the pain though it still left me very weak & suffering a good
deal. Polly not satisfied with Dr McCrea?s decision saw Dr Robertson. 257 He
however agreed with the C.M.O. that a sea voyage was not likely to be do me
good service & Polly was therefore obliged to give up the idea of getting rid
of me. Dr McCrea came in to see me in the afternoon & prescribed some
alterative pills which he directed me to take one each night & morning. Polly
had a long talk about money matters with me before we went to bed to-night;
she seems confident that if I let her have full control of my money she will
be able to get me out of debt. She wishes to sell the drawing room furniture
& to make other sacrifices. I have told her some of my difficulties & annoyed
her very much when I let her know that Simmies Interest was due for six
months. She thought there was but two months owing.
I have much to answer for, though I have been heavily weighted; with a
little more prudence I ought to have kept out of debt. If I had done so I
should have known none of these troubles. Insurance & Heavy interest
reduce my income so greatly that I cannot pay my way & every temporary
extrication of myself only the more fatally sinks me after a little respite from
the difficulties of my position.
Polly told me she had been talking of our affairs to Jardine Smith & that he was
anxious to help me as much as was in his power. Warder Brown offered Polly
assistance if money was what I wanted. I like Brown very much & would not
mind being under an obligation to him as a man but I could not borrow money
from a subordinate & so I told Polly very emphatically. She said she felt certain
such would be my decision & had let Brown understand as much. Browns kind
& disinterested offer made me feel very soft & the tell tale tears scalded my eyes
though I fought against their showing themselves.

June 14 Sunday 1874
Felt so helpless this morning that I struck my colours completely & remained
in bed. The doctor came to see me between ten & eleven o?clock & changed
my medicine. Polly was as full of attention as ever & could?ent do enough for
me to please herself. Johnny & Ernest looked bonny in their new clothes.
Harry went off with them for a walk while the little girls went to Church. 1
had some books to read & when I could get anything at all like an easy
position in bed I stayed satisfied. In the evening I got up & went down stairs
while my bed was being made & a little fresh air introduced into the room.
The girls & Harry went to Church.
I found it much more difficult than before to settle down in a comfortable
position in bed & passed a wretched time. Polly rubbed nearly a bottle full
of anodyne liniment about my body. It killed the pain for a little while but
not for long; however I got to sleep through it & that was something to be
very thankful for. Harry went to the Theatre Royal last night & was very
communicative to his Mamma with regard to all that he had seen. He did not
think much of the Girards in their celebrated piece they called Legmania.
Harry says he does?ent think they are men but demons, but was delighted
with the Burlesque of The White Fawn & particularly with the lines in it
spoken by Mr Greville & in which ?Castieau?s hotel? is alluded to. 258
I went on Saturday & paid my Insurance at the Alliance. Polly gave me �2O
but did?ent tell me where it came from.
June 18 Thursday 1874
My poor wife was regularly knocked up this afternoon with want of rest. I
have been so demonstrative in bed that I have prevented her a good deal from
even the chance of going to sleep & then poor creature she has been so
nervous about me & so much in dread of my having a fit that even when I
was asleep she could not settle down to calm repose herself. This lying awake
has worn her out & to-day she fully intended going to bed all the afternoon
but one thing after the other prevented her & I found her when I came into
the office at four o?clock this afternoon quite unsettled & with nerves
altogether unstrung. Old Gorman came to the door & saw Polly. The old
man when a prisoner in the Gaol was wardsman in the Front Yard & as he
had been an old soldier knew how to make himself very useful to Polly &
agreeable to the children. He does no good out of Gaol & I have relieved him
once or twice. To night he got 51- as positively a last contribution.
Polly frightened me, for after she had been talking to the old man she grew
quite maudlin & talked a lot of rubbish about how if I had gone off to
England she would have got into a cottage & had Gorman as servant to look
after the children &c &c; she was regularly tired out & fatigued beyond
endurance. Misfortunes never come alone & shortly after Gorman went
258 That is, Melbourne Gaol,


away, there was an enquiry for me at the front door & Polly went to see what
was wanted. I heard her arguing & not liking to leave her in the spirit she was
in to manage my business I went to see for myself & found a red faced
unsteady looking man at the door who hailed me as an old acquaintance &
said his name was Anderson of Anderson Brothers Cattle Dealers at
Beechworth. He had just come down he said with a mob of cattle &c. I asked
him in to the Dining Room as Polly hovered about & I was afraid of a bother.
She did tell Mr Anderson very plainly that I could not be troubled with
business, that I was very ill &c &c &c, & that I had to be left alone. I felt very
uncomfortable for some time watching my opportunity to get rid of my friend
who was evidently though well spoken rather ?tight?, when Polly put an end to
any chance of getting him to go, by asking him to have a cup of tea. She
evidently thought one would do him good. Anderson consented & drank the
tea, declining however to eat because ?dont you understand Mrs Castieau
I should be delighted to partake of your hospitality but I have no palate?. The
fellow was evidently well informed & decently educated & was lavish in his
admiration of my Beechworth character & of my reputation in that part of
the Country. His brother ?had never met another gentleman at Beechworth
besides myself?. Tea was at length over. Miss McDermott arrived & the
children all were ready for the Theatre. They came into the parlor & Mr
Anderson was delighted with their appearance. He must take his leave but
wanted to say a few words privately to me. I knew at once what was coming
& that I was ?sold again?. Would I let him have 8 or 10 shillings till to-morrow
afternoon between three & four o?clock, he could?ent go into town, he
could?ent do something else, it did?ent much matter what, to put him into
funds & had therefore come to me? I had no silver & just sufficient caution
left to prevent me giving him the whole of a pound, so I sent out for change
& fortunately smuggled Polly & the children away without them knowing
Mr Anderson?s errand. He is to come back punctually to-morrow afternoon.
I hope he may, of course I dont expect he will & yet I must confess that it
would?ent surprise me much if he were to take me in & show up with the ten
shillings & the pair of gloves that he was determined to make me accept.
June 20 Saturday 1874
All last night I slept heavily, too heavily in fact & to-day I had a head ache in
consequence. Dr McCrea 259 called me on one side & asked me if I still had
any thoughts about going on Leave because if I had my recent illness would
give me some claim & he should be inclined to go out of his way to assist me.
I spoke frankly to the doctor & told him that monetary difficulties had been
my great worry & that I could not go away & incur any expense by so doing.
He said that Mrs Castieau had led him to understand that I could go to
259 William McCrea (1814?1899), a leading medical administrator, he was Chairman of the
Central Board of Health, 1853-1879 ( Australian Dictionary of Biography).


England & back without expence & I was then obliged to assure him that so
far as I was concerned I had no idea of how such an arrangement could be
made. I said that if the Government could give me something to do at a
distance away from Melbourne & pay my expences in going to & returning
from my work I should be delighted & that I was perfectly satisfied if I could
leave Mrs Castieau my pay, she would do better with it without me than if I
were at home but that it would be of no use my leaving her with less than my
present salary. The doctor was very kind & I promised to think over the
matter of Leave & to tell him as a friend whatever I considered it best to do.
June 23 Tuesday 1874
Did not sleep very soundly & at about three o?clock heard one of the children
sobbing as if there was something very much the matter, went to the room
the crying came from & found Godfrey very upset. When I asked him what
was the matter, he said, ?Oh Papa as soon as ever I shut my eyes the people
come & make faces at me.? The poor little fellow generally is very brave but
1 suppose he must have had night mares. He is very active but for the last two
days has had no running about owing to a sprained foot. I soothed him as
well as I could but it took him some time to stop the sobs & Sissy heard him
before he succeeded. She got up to take him to her bed & Mamma then
went & brought him to mine; he soon went to sleep & stayed so till it was
time to get up.
Polly went to-day to see Mr Murray Smith about our affairs, he could only
recommend our coming to a regular compromise with our creditors offering
them, if they would give us time, 10/- in the pound & to pay in full after four
years if we were able. I could not see my way at all to act in this manner towards
Simmie or the good friends who have gone Security for us with the Alliance. I
would much rather try & pay every-body. Simmie must be content with his
Interest alone for some time & I must see whether the Alliance will consent to
allow the debt to them to remain over for 12 months on my paying the
Assurance & Interest. If the Company will agree to this 1 think the Securities
would be foolish to object. Simmie must be paid at once the Interest due to
him & his permission obtained for us to sell what furniture we can do without,
with the money we get we must meet McClures bill 260 & then grind along the
best way we can manage.
June 28 Sunday 1874
Took Johnny with me into the Gaol Church to hear Mr Mantell. Polly & the
other children with the exception of Ernest, went to St John?s. After Service
was over in the Gaol Mr Mantell came into my Quarters & sat & chatted for
nearly an hour; we got on very well indeed together.
260 McClure, Valentine & Co., wholesale grocers and wine and spirit merchants at 240 Elizabeth
Street.


In the afternoon I started by the four o?clock train for Hawthorn on the
way to Kerferd?s house. When I got to Kerferd?s I found besides the family
Messrs Stewart, Morison & Townsend; stayed till it was time to go away in
order not to miss the eight o?clock buss, had no chance of talking to Kerferd
about my own affairs, he seemed however to consider that I might reasonably
expect to obtain a twelve months Leave on full pay if I asked for it. Got home
by a little after nine o?clock & went to bed before eleven.
Kerferd evidently very much worked. I am sure to night that he was glad
to get rid of us. He had some Bill to read over although he had been at his
office the whole of the day previous notwithstanding Saturdays being
generally considered as Holidays in Government Offices. I think Kerferd
would be very glad indeed to have a Solicitor General. At present he is
Attorney General & Acting Solicitor General also. Mrs Kerferd cant get a
servant & so all the Attorney?s General?s establishment besides his wife
& children consists of one little nurse girl. 261 Mrs Kerferd however seemed
jolly enough & no doubt can be grand enough when circumstances require
her to sink the housewife & appear as the better half of the Honorable The
Attorney General.
June 30 Tuesday 1874
Dr Robertson came across to see me this morning about the letter that I sent
him yesterday; the doctor expressed his willingness to help me as much as was
in his power but was frightened at something he had read a short time ago in
which an Assurance Company had been represented as having called upon
Surety to pay the whole of a loan & refused to allow him to pay the amount in
instalments. I assured Dr Robertson as well as I could that there was no fear of
his being treated in that manner & he signed as I had requested. In the
morning I went to see Mr Lucas of the Alliance & told him what Dr Robertson
had been afraid of & he told me the case the doctor alluded to was not in the
Alliance Office but what had occurred was that the Sureties had shirked their
liability & the Company had only fairly protected itself. He said if anything
was required from the Sureties they would all receive notice & all be treated
alike. After leaving the Alliance I went to Craig?s office & found Simmie sitting
there. I paid �21.11.8 Interest which I thought would be to the end of June but
Craig on looking at his books, said he made it to the end of July.
Tuesday EVENING. Polly after she had had her tea went off to see Mr Alston
with regard to the bill we owe Alston & Brown. I wrote a note for her to give
to Mr Alston. Polly returned buoyant, she had been extremely well received
by Mr & Mrs Alston & on her alluding to the account told not to worry
about it; the terms I offered were Bills at 3, 6, 9 & 12 months with discount
261 The shortage of servants in colonial Melbourne was notorious. See Graeme Davison,
The Rise and Fall of Marvellous Melbourne , pp. 202-204.


added. Mr Alston said he would much rather I met some of my creditors &
made a compromise of 10/- in the pound extending over 18 months. As for
himself he would accept it. He told Polly to send me to his office & that he
would see if we could?ent manage something. Mr Alston took Polly to the
Railway Station, paid for her ticket & behaved in the kindest manner
possible. Of course when Polly told me this I was very glad & we began to
feel more hopeful, soon however there arose a difficulty. I felt if I went to Mr
Alston I must tell him all, & then incidentally was mentioned that we owed
�lB to Robertson & Moffitt rival drapers & to whom Polly went when she
was ashamed to go to Alston & Brown without they were paid. Polly does
not like the idea of Alston knowing of this. I cannot see how it is to be
avoided unless to run the risk of appearing to have acted disingenuously.
July 1 Wednesday 1874
Suffering from a very bad cold. This was what was called a Holiday in
consequence of its being the anniversary of Separation from N.S. Wales. The
Civil Service kept holiday & so did the Banks. There was however no change
in Gaol life. I went in the afternoon to see Mr Alston of Alston & Brown.
Alston was very kind & recommended me to go at once to see McClure
Valantine & Co. & make terms with them. I went & had a talk with Major
Radcliffe; he said that Mr McClure did the finance part of the business &
that he could not give me any answer till he had consulted him. I saw
however enough to show that I was?ent in favor & that I should have trouble,
returned home & had some talk with Polly. Played bagatelle in the evening
& went to bed at about ten o?clock.
While I was in town this morning I had to wait for Mr Alston as he was
gone to lunch so I strolled down the street thinking to call upon Murray
Smith, his place of business was however shut up & I turned back to go to
Alston?s. Passing Captain Coffey?s place he invited me in & would be very
friendly. He prescribed & got a bottle of medicine for me, of the same kind
as he was taking himself, assuring me it would make me all right if my liver
was?ent completely frizzled up, or enlarged beyond redemption. I promised I
would take the Physic & not tell Dr McCrea anything about having done so.
July 2 Thursday 1874
The first thing this morning I wrote a letter to McClure Valantine & Co
offering them �3 Cash & �3 per month until their account was settled; in
return I got back a very hard letter indeed which alluded to my cool proposal
& threatened if I did not meet my Account when the Bill became due the
Firm would take immediate steps to enforce payment & lay the whole matter
before the Chief Secretary. The last threat was galling but 1 did not mind it
much as I do not care how much the Chief Secretary knows about my affairs.
I would?ent have gone to McClure & Co. had not I felt it incumbent upon


me to take Mr Alston?s advice & do so & not to do as I proposed, sell my
furniture to meet the Promissory Note that I had given.
Polly went out & saw Mr Alston, he advised her to go to Murray Smith,
that gentleman was however not at business. Polly however met him & made
an appointment for to-morrow at eleven o?clock. Polly had a biscuit & a glass
of wine with Mr Galbraith at his office.
Two men were flogged this afternoon. Gately has been fussing about the Gaol
for the past week waiting for the job; he did his work & got paid his pound.
Mustered the women & the old Wing. Mr Duncan interrupted me just as
I was commencing the New Wing & so I left it to Quin. Mr Duncan talked
away very pleasantly & told me that he was going away for a few days. After
tea I went to the Athenaeum & read the papers in the reading room. As I was
returning home, I went into a place in Bourke Street where a number of men
were amusing themselves with rifle shooting; whenever a bull?s eye was made,
there was music sounded or some other prominent announcement of the fact
from the target that was struck. Duerdin saw me & we went for a stroll. The
Yorick Club does not appear to be very flourishing & there seems to be some
intention of removing it from its present premises.
When I got home I had a game of bagatelle with Polly & then went in for
a smoke & a glass of toddy. Jardine Smith called to see us & joined me in a
smoke & drink.
Judge Cope & the Rev. Mr McMillan who I used to know at Beechworth
went through the Gaol this morning. The Judge had two daughters with him.
July 3 Friday 1874
Polly in a great state of mind to-day & started at once this morning to see
Murray Smith with regard to McClure & Go?s Account. Smith advised her to
go to McClure?s & she did so. McClure was very stiff & inclined to be
particularly nasty; he made the remark that he was afraid I had brought some
of my misfortune on myself & hinted that I was not perfectly sober when I
called upon them on Wednesday. This was however a great mistake on their
part. I had been upset & was worried with the business I had on hand & had
overwalked myself in a heavy coat. I had though but just come from Mr
Alston with whom I had been talking for half an hour & certainly took
nothing at Alston?s or on my way to McClure?s. I had some sherry & bitters
twice with Captn. Coffey before I went to Mr Alston but this was all. I parted
with Coffey at Mr Alston?s. McClure would only agree to half cash & the
other half at a month; he promised however to speak to Major Radcliffe his
partner & see if he would agree to any further concession. McClure came up
to the house in the afternoon & agreed to take flO Cash & �lO per month
afterwards. This Polly consented to. She told McClure so & at the same time
let him know that I had heard what he had said about me. This he did?ent
seem to like but Polly told him she had no secrets from me.


July 4 Saturday 1874
Wrote a letter to McClure Valantine & Co & sent it with a cheque for �lO
on account of their bill. Polly went to Murray Smith & got a cheque from
him for �lO of Harriette?s money which is to be paid back in January. I sent
a receipt for this to Murray Smith & also wrote & thanked Joe White for his
kindness in signing the Assurance paper.
Spent the morning in the office. Polly came & said she was going to see
Cameron the baker, so I wrote her a note to take to him. In this I told him
that I could?ent at present pay what I owed him & that I should be much
obliged if he would allow us to pay cash for what we had in future with �2
per month of the old account; according to Polly Mr Cameron made not the
slightest objection.
Polly also saw McLauclan the Grocer. He was at first remarkably
acquiescent but afterwards sent Polly a note in which he asked for �3 cash.
Polly did?ent seem to mind this a bit however but simply said, the man cant
have it & there?s an end of the matter.
July 5 Sunday 1874
Polly was tired out with her exertions of the past week & did not care about
going to Church, so I took most of the children & went to St Johns. Dr
Bromby preached a sermon in behalf of the Pastoral Aid Society. The old
gentleman was very impressive & preached an excellent discourse.
Polly made up her mind to go to Elsternwick & stay the afternoon with
Dotty; she could not however muster up courage to dress & after delaying from
train to train at length sensibly made up her mind that after all she would be
best at home. Poor girl she kept up wonderfully well when the work was to be
done then came reaction & she was used up. The children are a continual
plague, they are far from being bad youngsters but are a continual irritation. It?s
Ma, Ma, Ma, all day long & ?please I want this? or ?Johnny?s doing that? or ?Sissy
wont do tother?, till all chance of rest or quiet is put an end to.
In the evening I sat down to read The Vicar?s Daughter & got so interested
in it that I began to read tit bits aloud. Polly who was very tired got interested
also & pressed me to go on reading. I did so till nearly ten o?clock, then we
had some toddy & went to bed.
July 6 Monday 1874
The General Sessions Court is still going on. This morning rhe trial of a
young man named Kitts, a clerk in the Waterworks office, commenced. He
was charged with stealing a cash box from the office. The Case was only
partly heard & then the prisoner was liberated on bail & the Jury were
dismissed to their homes for the night. This practice of allowing a jury to
disperse before a case is over is one of only modern date & is I think a
mischievous innovation. Jurors are but men & will talk & listen to talk away


from the Jury box; they are likely to hear a great deal about the Case they
have to Decide & may be influenced by tattle instead of evidence. No doubt
it is very hard to be locked up all night, still if I were judge I should be
inclined to subject a jury who had commenced a case to it, if they were
unable to finish without & I should also keep a prisoner in custody after he
had once been given in charge until the charge against him was fully decided.
July 22 Wednesday 1874
While I was at Muster this evening a woman made a very great complaint to
me about the dinner she had served to her to-day & among other things said
that she had got no meat. I called the officer who had charge of the rations
& she assured me that the woman had had actually more than her share.
It seemed to me that the prisoner was telling a very bare-faced lie & so to
make it a caution to her & others I sentenced her to two days Solitary
Confinement. The officer who served the dinner is a Miss Byrne recently
removed from Geelong. She is one of the Queen?s dear bargains & is so far as
I can judge about as unsuited for her position as a woman well could be; it
seems however that let one of the people get a hold of a Government billet
there is little chance of getting rid of him or her for the future unless
something outrageously wrong in the manner of conduct calls public
attention to the impropriety of the individual receiving Government pay. In
a business if Miss Byrne had proved herself not the proper person to remain
employed, she would have been dispensed with. In the Public Service she was
transferred & when found unsuited for a little Gaol was sent to a big one.
July 23 Thursday 1874
My old enemy bile got hold of me to-day & clawed away at my head with great
power. I bore up against him with all my might but after mid-day I had to
succumb & go in for an emetic. I was in the midst of the trouble occasioned
by hot water after emetic when I was called upon to write a letter & deal with
a woman who Mr Duncan considered had been punished as much in
consequence of the irregularity of an officer as for her own misconduct.
Mr Duncan was here this morning & apparrently very friendly. I got on
very well with him. After he was gone however I got a private note with
regard to the woman I have mentioned above & at his request I remitted the
punishment I had passed upon her.
To-day Polly was full of excitement in consequence of a Sale of cheap boots for
children & women that was going on at Carsons. It would appear that at this
shop there is being turned out a heap of stock more or less damaged & that these
originally first class boots are being sold at much below the usual rate for first class
goods. Polly bought some. Alfred Darvall is down from Beechworth to get the
benefit of Turkish Baths, he called upon us this afternoon. Went to the
Athenaeum in the evening. When I came home I found Charley Gee engaged


with our youngsters singing comic songs & making himself otherwise
entertaining. The children enjoyed his company very much; before he went away
he joined Harry & myself in some Shakesperian Readings.
July 24 Friday 1874 262
As usual of late commenced coughing as soon as I woke up. Polly very feeble
& unwell.
Went into the office at usual time & worked away in the usual routine
fashion. There was a woman charged with Insolence & 1 had to deal with her.
It shows how dangerous any interference is with the power given to the
Governor of a Gaol to correct his prisoners, or rather how quickly any
interference is noticed & laid hold off by prisoners. This woman who had been
very impertinent flounced out of the office after I had punished her saying,
?that really Mr Duncan must be made aware of the way things were being
carried on?. This showing off was of course caused by the punishment being
remitted of the woman I have mentioned in my Diary of yesterday.
July 27 Monday 1874
Coughed away for a time this morning but managed to get a very good
breakfast for all that. Went into the office & remained there till routine work
was finished. In the afternoon went to the Treasury & got the money that was
due, then called at the Crown Law Offices & saw Kerferd who promised if Mr
Francis left office he would ask him to leave a favorable Memo, for me
in the office. After I had left Kerferd I went to the Detective Office & saw there
a Photograph of a man who had been shot at Ballan while attempting a robbery
or some other crime. I could not identify the individual. The Photo was
however taken after Death & was not the more recognisable on that account.
Mustered and then after a little chat with Alfred Darvall went to the
Athenaeum. Darvall walking into town with me.
Semple came to our house & stayed to tea. In the evening he played Bezique
with Mrs Castieau & then drank & smoked with me. Semple has been
sounded as to his willingness to write some articles for The Ovens and Murray
& asked me what I knew about Warren. I told him the truth & expressed my
belief that the proprietor of The Ovens and Murray Advertiser was sure pay. Polly
& I had a stormy discussion about the children & their music, Polly being very
severe upon the State schools. Did?ent get to bed till after one o?clock.
July 28 Tuesday 1874
There was great enquiry to-day at the Gaol about Maher the old man who
Died yesterday. The Newspapers all seemed anxious for full information
regarding the Claimant?s last hours. In the evening McKinley sent me a note in
iware of the way things were being
262 Includes entry for 25 July.


which after asking about Maher, he told me that Francis had resigned & that
it was understood Kerferd would be called upon to form a Ministry.
The Government supporters had a meeting to-day at which they mustered
very strong & it would appear that when it was thoroughly understood
Francis would not continue in office even though allowed Leave, it was
decided that Kerferd would be the best man to represent the Party & that Mr
Francis should advise his Excellency to send for him to take the responsibility
of forming a new, or rather to re-construct the old, Ministry. To mention a
little personal matter, it seems funny that I should have yesterday gone to
Kerferd to ask him to get Francis to leave a favorable minute on my papers
& have made the remark, ?lt would help me so very much with the next one?,
little dreaming that Kerferd would himself succeed Mr Francis as Chief
Secretary. Had some flogging to-day. Bellew came up to see it. Alfred Darvall
was here this morning & I took him to see Lynch. Mr Lynch gave him a lot
of information & promised to introduce him to the Sheriff. I am afraid
Alfred is not very bright & that his billet will be rather too much for him.
Did not muster but went to the Athenaeum to read the papers. Stayed at
home in the evening & read for a while, then smoked for a time, then
coughed for a change & then sucked liquorice till it was time to go to bed.
July 29 Wednesday 1874
Plenty Cough again to-day. The papers showed that the information sent
me last night by McKinley was correct, Mr Francis had resigned &
recommended Kerferd to be sent for. Langton it is said has taken the sulks &
declined to be anything but Leader of a re-constructed Ministry. It was said
also that Casey would do the high & mighty business & also retire; in my
opinion he will think twice before abandoning his port-folio & that in a few
days Langton will gnaw his nails in vexation at having out of vainglorious
sentiment thrust away the sweets of the Treasury-ship.
An Inquest was held on the body of Maher this afternoon between one &
two o?clock. It was a very awkward hour for the enquiry, as the Gaol officers
were taking their reliefs for dinner & the poor jurymen captured outside the
Gaol were all men leaving their work for the dinner hour.
One juryman who was afterwards made foreman was very bounceable
because there was no room for him to sit down immediately he was brought
inside the gate & because, as he indignantly remarked, the jury had to stand in
the Gaol Yard like a flock of sheep until twelve had been gathered together. I
tried to soothe, but it appeared that my gentleman had attended Inquests at
Yarra Bend & that there the Jurors were treated with all proper consideration.
At last I got out of temper & told him I had done so. At the Inquest my friend
as I have before remarked was appointed foreman of the jury & displayed a
great knowledge of corpses & of what their appearance ought to be. I did?ent
want any discontent of my treatment to the Jury to be shown & so after they


had given in their verdict I talked to the Coroner about the inconvenient hour
at which the Inquest was held & he explained circumstances that showed it to
have been unavoidable. Then I condoled with them for losing their dinner time
& made a little fun out of the inconvenience serving ones Country sometimes
entailed. Dr Youl helped in the rubbing down & the 12 citizens went away in
tolerable good humour. My foreman friend hoped I would excuse him? & I in
return hoped he would excuse me?. The verdict of the Jury was that ?Death was
caused from Disease of the brain?.
August 1 Saturday 1874
About the Gaol all day. Went to the Athenaeum in the afternoon & spent the
evening at home. Polly still complaining very much of neuralgia. Do not
remember anything particular occurring to-day, bought The Leader & The
Australasian. As I was going to the Athenaeum I met Marcus Clarke & we
walked together so far as the Yarra Ferry. Clarke seems all the better for his
Insolvency. He informed me that no one had appeared at the meetings to
oppose him & that he had an order from the Assignee to draw his salary. 263
As we went along Swanston Street I invited him to go into Clements in
order that we might have a look at the new place just opened. It is certainly
a fine house. We met Levey afterwards & had a little talk with him; he asked
our opinions with regard to an article of this day in The Age entitled a lady?s
opinion of things of the day. Both of us spoke of it in a commendatory spirit.
The lady suggests that some one of position should try & make nice society
in Melbourne; she acknowledged that the Governor has necessarily to invite
a mixed crowd to his balls, but thinks so far as his own visiting is concerned
he might draw the line somewhere & that in her opinion it was scarcely the
thing for him to go to lunch at a house where the proprietor had recently
come out of Gaol for Assaulting a publican, particularly when the said
proprietor had nothing to recommend him beyond being well off, owing to
having had left him his father?s money gained while keeping a public house.
The lady of course referred to Pindar of Pindar & Wilson who conducted
themselves very badly at Scott?s Hotel some time ago & were in consequence
sent to Gaol for ten days. Pindar keeps Greyhounds & has coursing meetings
to one of which His Excellency accepted an invitation. Made things right for
Sissy & Dotty who have been for a few days in disgrace with their Mamma.
They promised to be good girls for the future.
August 12 Wednesday 1874
T here was not much excitement to-day things going on very quietly indeed.
I went to see the Sheriff in the morning & had a long talk with him about
Malachi Foley his old servant & who was convicted of stealing from the
263 On Clarke's bankruptcy in August 1874 see Brian Elliott, Marcus Clarke (Oxford, 1952),
pp. 176-177.


Railway Shed. Mr Foley it appears after all is not so clean a potatoe in the
eyes of the Sheriff as Mr O?Lochlen the Crown Prosecutor represented him
to be. He looks upon him as the honest man, who stole two bottles of brandy.
A week or two ago Polly made up her mind to Visit the Lady Mayoress &
promised to accompany my sister & Mrs Harrison. A day or two ago
however, a paragraph appeared in one of the papers to the effect that the
Mayor intended to give a Fancy Dress Ball before going out of Office; this
made Polly hesitate, as it seemed after such a notification to look so much
like cadging, making a formal call upon the Mayoress. Emma & Mrs
Harrison came for Polly & she would?ent go which I think riled both ladies
very much. I stopped in the Office until after five o?clock, then I went into
Melbourne. The first I met to whom I stopped to speak was Mr Hart, the
Treasurer of the Aid Society. He was indignant at the way he had been treated
by the celebrated Bathurst on Monday, much as it was against the grain of
Mr Hart who did not believe in Bathurst. 1 out of Policy succeeded in getting
him an allowance of ten shillings a week for six weeks to repay Mrs Bathurst
for expense of boarding him while he was seeking employment. Bathurst?s
familiars, by whom I mean those who knew his circumstances well, wanted
to invest a trifle in stocking a wood & coal yard for him, paying the rent of
premises, obtaining a hand cart & other etceteras of the business. Others who
knew Bathurst were perfectly well aware that he was?ent at all the sort of man
to wheel a cart, cut up wood or do any other manual labor & would?ent
throw away the Society?s money on the chance. My compromise was
accepted. Bathurst however waited to day on the Treasurer & accused the
Committee of having insulted him by the offer they had made, insinuated
that but for his friend Sir Redmond Barry?s interest, the Society would not
have noticed him & threatened of course to show the Society up. Let him, he
had previously three pounds of the Society?s funds.
August 20 Thursday 1874
During Thursday, Friday & Saturday there has been a great Case being tried
before Judge Barry, Mr Harwood of the Theatre Royal & other Theatres
having brought an Action against the Publisher of The Herald for Libel
contained in the Critiques on the places of amusement published in the
Evening Journal, 2M
For some reason or other the theatres ceased to advertise in The Herald &
then that Paper began to get wonderfully moral & to pitch into Harwood &
Co on the Class of Performances they were presenting to the public, stating
it would appear as if the managers were encouraging a ?social evil?. Two sisters
known as the Duvallis have been for some time engaged as dancers, one being
dressed in male ballet costume. The criticism referred to them & to the
Girards, the latter performers being young fellows who performed in a Piece
264 This libel case is discussed in ibid., pp. 206-207.


called Legmania & in which they threw their legs into very astonishing
positions. One of the Girards burlesqued a female. Pictures of the Duvallis &
the Girards were handed about the Court during the trial which was not
concluded on Saturday. Most of the theatrical people & the Reporters were
hanging about the Court while it was going on. 265 Telo I heard was asked if
the Duvallis? Performance was not enough to send excitable men away at
once to a brothel. Well said Telo, they never had such an effect upon me; but
supposing you were a young man from the Country? Well said Telo, I must,
to have had any such sensation, been a very long time up Country. It came
out in evidence that Marcus Clarke wrote the critique complained of & this
must have been rather awkward for him as it appeared he had positively
denied having done so to Harwood. The Princess ofTrebizonde was said to
have [been] put upon the stage in a mutilated condition & in order that the
Jury might see what it was like it was put upon the Boards again to night.
Ellis offered to get me a ticket for a Party of Ladies but I declined with thanks
principally before [i.e. because] I did?ent care at being patronised or to be
seen with ladies at a piece of a doubtful character. This Princess ofTrebizonde
has had a great run & some of the catch sayings have got into favor about
Melbourne, One especially ?Keep your eye on your father & he will pull you
through?. I shall leave space here to record the verdict of the Jury when the
trial is over.
This case was concluded on Tuesday & a verdict for the Plaintiff given.
Damages one farthing on each count.
August 22 Saturday 1874
Had a very bad night, being awake for hours with my cough & suffering very
much from a wheezing on my chest which when I breathed made a very nasty
disagreeable singing noise. Rev. Mr Mantell called & asked me to take the
Services in the Gaol for him to-morrow & I consented, hoarse as I was, for I
did not like to refuse having once or twice offered to do so if it would be any
advantage to him. At Eleven o?clock, a Tall stout determined looking lady
with a grim casket in her hand, to lock up the souls she got hold of may be,
walked into my office & announced herself as Mrs Ferguson saying she had
made an appointment with Dr Singleton to meet me at eleven o?clock to
make arrangements for visiting the female prisoners. I made some
observation, when Mrs Ferguson immediately stopped me by saying that
perhaps the conversation had better be deferred till the arrival of the doctor.
I said no more but went on with my work until Dr Singleton put in an
appearance. My visitors then proceeded to take the Gaol by storm & seemed
to take it as a matter of course that they would be heartily welcomed. I urged
that there was no time to attend upon visitors & that the Government
provided pastors for the prisoners, remarking that if the people out of Gaol
265 This entry is written across dates 20?21 August 1874.


were as well looked after as those who were in Gaol, they would have plenty
to try to do them good. Mr Singleton began to talk of the good that he had
done especially at Pentridge. I mildly said that even there his work had not
been altogether satisfactory. This made him very sore & he railed against the
late Mr Price, who on the ground that Dr Singleton was taking out messages
for prisoners, refused to let him visit the prison after a time. Sweet Mrs
Ferguson remarked that it would have been so different with her & Mr Price
as Mr Price knew her work so well in Hobart Town. I sent for Mrs Gee &
introduced her & let Mrs Ferguson understand that I could only encourage
her visiting the Gaol in connexion with Mr Mantell. I certainly have a great
objection to persons not connected with the Gaol coming to it and expecting
to be allowed to run about as if they had a right to do so. 266
Felt so ill that I stayed at home all this afternoon & evening & went to bed
at nine o?clock.
August 28 Friday 1874
Paid Mr Wilmot my subscription of one guinea to the Prisoners Aid Society.
Saw some prisoners go away at six o?clock this morning to Maryborough.
Some of them were rare boys though only under 12 months sentences. I was
a little fidgetty in directing Quin about them & was glad to see them off all
right. It being so early in the morning there was only the Night Staff on duty.
This was Harry?s birthday, he was thirteen years old to-day. He went to bed
last night full of promises to his mamma of being a good boy. He
commenced the morning by shouting out of the window to the Police Van
Driver in charge of the Maryborough prisoners ?Allez houp-la?, ?keep your eye
on your father? &c.
I told him a nice character of this Gaol the prisoners would take to their
new prison being able to tell how the Governor?s son shouted at them &
mocked them out of the window when they were going away at six o?clock
in the morning. Harry fumed & said it was no good trying to be good, he
could?ent be that was certain. He calmed down however & went off to
School tolerably jolly having got sixpence from his mother & sixpence from
Mr Brown.
An Inquest was held this afternoon on the remains of a man who Died in
the Gaol yesterday. This man had been convicted of Stealing a piece of soap
from the lavatory for the use of the public at the Melbourne Library; the soap
had mysteriously disappeared on several occasions & it was therefore watched
until one day this man Robert Nelson was found putting a piece of it into his
266 John Singleton (1808-1891), a doctor and philanthropist, was also known for his strong religious
views. His evangelism in gaols had been resisted by Inspector-General John Price in the 1850s
and was continued by Inspector-General Duncan in 1875 (at Castieaus recommendation) and
again by Castieau when he held that office in 1881. See Public Record Office Victoria: VPRS
3991/P, Box 840, Item 75/H6227; VPRS, 3991/P, Box 1264, Item 81/V1895.


pocket. He was apprehended & sentenced to 14 days labor. This man had
been a draper at home in England, here he took his stand in one of the streets
as a shoeblack from seven till twelve each morning & then spent the
remainder of the day at the Public Library studying theology. He received
remittances from some one in the Old Country & used to be pretty well
soaked with beer before he went to bed of a night. This was one of the Cases
which I cannot help terming the failures of Dr McCrea?s treatment; when
Nelson came into the Gaol he appeared in tolerable health & was sent to the
Labor Yard. There he remained without making any complaint for 5 or 6
days, when he complained of rheumatism & was put in the Hospital. He got
emetic & low diet the first day, low diet the second day, low diet the third
day & then he was very low & Dr McCrea ordered him Essence of beef,
Brandy & in fact anything he would take. He refused however to rally & died
the next day. I walked down Russell Street with Dr Youl & the Coroner
expressed himself very strongly that there would be a row about the emetic
& low diet treatment some day, & went so far as to say that Nelson instead
of low diet ought to have had 20 oz of brandy the first day he complained of
the Rheumatism. The Post Mortem showed that he was suffering from
Pneumonia when he died & so he must have been three days before. I feel
placed somewhat awkwardly. I like McCrea very much & I would not like to
be unfriendly with him but I would risk that if I could see my way to do any
good. He is a doctor & fully qualified, makes no secret of his practice & in
fact justifies it & thoroughly believes in it as a conscientious man like him
would believe in what he done. His treatment too with nine out of ten of the
patients he gets is efficacious. The stomach is generally out of order from
excess & an emetic clears off what is working against nature. The pulling
down to build up again as tried in the Case of Nelson makes one rather funky
when it has such a result for it looks too muchee like, ?killing, no murder?.
Awfully bilious tried an emetic & went to bed early.
August 30 Sunday 1874
This was a boisterous windy day. I went to church with the girls & with Walter
& Godfrey. Mamma was rheumatic & was obliged to nurse herself at home. In
the afternoon I went to Kew & visited the Kerferds. Mr Anderson & Judge
Cope were with the Premier when I saw him. Cope stayed & we came away
together by the nine train from Hawthorn, met Anderson the Clerk of the
Melbourne Bench at the Station. He came to town in the same railway carriage.
Did not say anything about my own affairs to Kerferd. The Prime Minister was
cordial enough but yet seemed to have an innate consciousness of the dignity of
his position & that he was overpowering me with a sense of the condescension
with which he treated me. I do not wonder if his head gets a little giddy, his
exaltation is so great & sudden. I think I would have preferred for myself that
Francis had remained Chief & Kerferd a Member of the Ministry.


September 1 Tuesday 1874
There are a number of poor wretches knocking about Melbourne who have
once upon a time been in a respectable condition of life but who are now
reduced to the most miserable shifts to obtain a bare existence. One of these
men is Gahan; he is an attorney but has drank away his prospects, friends &
opportunities. O?Loghlen to his sorrow knows him & is hunted by him for
small sums to enable him to get a bed & a meal. He has been in Gaol as a
vagrant & so is acquainted with me; sometimes he gives O?Loghlen a relief
& begs of me. To-day he did. I gave the poor wretch a shilling with a grumble
&C he promised really to settle down to something immediately. Strictly
speaking the man deserves no pity & what pity do I deserve for the troubles
myself & family are bearing when I remember how much I have spent that
might have been saved & how wasteful & extravagant I have been at times.
September 2 Wednesday 1874
In the office at usual time & transacted ordinary business though I did not go
near the Court. In the afternoon there were two men flogged, one had been
knocking about the Gaol Yard for nearly six months & had evidently got at the
dogger, for when that noble individual began to dourish the cats, I could see
he intended to use them lightly & so he did although he paraded very carefully;
the next man evidently was due for no consideration & he got it so hot that Dr
McCrea whispered to me that the man was being dogged too severely. I
checked Gately & the remainder of the whipping was of a milder nature. This
is the first time that I have seen Dr McCrea show any feeling of this nature.
In presence of the doctor I called the dogger up to me & told him that I
was satisded he had not dogged the drst man as he ought to have done &
that he had been paid in some way or other for not doing his duty; the fellow
looked conscience-stricken & impudent as he generally is did?ent open his
mouth. I shall look after him to-morrow.
There was a very distressing Case came under my notice this morning. Some
time since a draper who had been in the employ of Buckley & Nunn was sent
to Gaol for 14 days for pilfering. While he was serving his sentence it was shown
that he was silly & I got him committed as a lunatic; on the day that he was due
for his discharge a delicate little woman came to the Gaol to take him away &
was almost heart broken when she found that he was going to the Asylum. The
man was her husband, the poor little thing had a baby & she was thoroughly
helpless in consequence. She told me she expected remittances from England &
that she then meant to take her husband home, that Mr Alston of Alston &
Brown had promised to help her & that she thought she could manage if I
would only give him up to her. I persuaded her that the Asylum was by far the
best place for her husband to be at & promised all sorts of kind things for her
until I got her to go away somewhat contented. At Muster time the lunatic
himself begged to be allowed to go home & assured me of the excellent


prospects he had if he could only get back to work. I talked to him & lied to
him as is supposed to be correct with insane folk & left him satisfied. This
morning the little woman ruffled all my feathers again, she wanted her husband
& she could?ent do without him, her landlady was remorseless & insisted on her
paying the rent or going as she called it ?on to the streets?. I argued in vain about
my being obliged to send her husband to the Asylum; ?what was she to do
without him?? was her only answer. He can mind the baby while I go out to
work. I know I can keep him all right. I fussed & fumed, quietly I am glad to
say, & at length wrote to the Chief Medical officer, Mr McCrea, to say that I
would let the man go if he approved. I gave this to the little woman in good faith
but not expecting much from the doctor?s reply, yet to my astonishment in a
very short time the little one again returned with a memo, from the doctor
saying he had no objection to the man being taken charge of by his wife. I gave
orders for him to be set at liberty & then the little one told me the doctor had
given her a pound to try & commence fairly; by & bye the poor lunatic was
brought to the office & immediately began to talk of his brilliant prospects when
he got back to Buckley & Nunn?s. Sad to say the man?s mind was gone & in his
condition he could not possibly have been tolerated behind a counter. He asked
his wife if he were to go back to-morrow & she replied with great sweetness &
with pathos ?not to-morrow dear you are not quite cured yet you know?. Then
the poor fellow enlarged again to me on the money he used to make by the large
sales he effected & in a gentlemanly manner thanked Cameron the prisoner
hospital attendant for his kindness to him. I saw the man & wife going away &
thanked God for all his mercies & in my heart begged for forgiveness for all my
wicked & selfish repinings against his judgments. When Dr McCrea came to-
day he said that he wished he had had �5 instead of �1 to give the poor woman.
He considered hers a real case of distress while day after day he was pestered by
idle loafers who wanted assistance without deserving it.
Entry written on diary pages for September 7-9
On Saturday September sth 1 went ill to bed. 267 This is Tuesday November
16th [i.e. 17th], I am pronounced convalescent but still suffer from
rheumatic pains & find that I am unable to take but little exercise without
suffering for it with groggy knees & swollen ancles. I have not gone into the
Gaol yet to do any work & do not suppose I shall until I have been for a little
spell. Mathews has given me an invitation to Albury & Polly seems to have
made up her mind that I shall accept it; as yet however I have not decided
upon going away anywhere myself but suppose Polly will as usual make me
do what she thinks will be best for me.
Soon after I was taken ill Dr Macrea gave a certificate to the effect that 1
required twelve months Leave of Absence; some of my friends suggested that it
267 Castieau applied for 12 months leave on 22 September 1874, but this was refused. He was
on sick leave until 12 December.


would be an excellent opportunity for me to get a change & yet do some good
while I was having it, both for myself & the Government. It was proposed in
The Argus that I should go to America & then to Europe & visit the principal
prisons in both Continents so that I might be enabled when I returned to
furnish reports of the different systems of Prison management that came under
my notice so that it might be seen whether Victoria could?ent take some
wrinkles from one or other of them. This would have suited me admirably &
I jumped at the idea. At the time I was unable to write myself so Polly did the
Secretary & wrote for me to the Premier & to Mr Duncan, the Head of my
Department. I asked for 12 months Leave on full pay & said how glad I should
be to be employed in visiting the Gaols. After some time an answer came in the
shape of a memo, from the Penal Department stating that the Ministerial Head
of the Department was willing to give me twelve months on half pay. At the
time this answer was received I was very ill indeed and Polly, on the doctor?s
advice, did not let me know of it. She took the letter however up to Kerferd &
he seemed to know nothing about it; the Premier however agreed with Polly,
that Half Pay would of course be useless in my Case & that I was to get well
& then make another application for the Leave I wanted. I saw Mr Duncan &
he said he could?ent understand why the Leave was refused as he had
recommended it & advised me to apply for six months on full pay. Mr Duncan
could not he said recommend that one in my position should visit with a view
to reporting on other Gaols & I suppose his veto stopped the Government or
rather Mr Ramsay the Acting Chief Secretary from entertaining my proposal.
While I was ill Mr Adamson the American Consul called & evidently was
under the idea that I was going to the States; he seemed very anxious that I
should go & offered me all the assistance in his power towards forwarding my
views if I did take a trip to his country.
November 15 Sunday 1874
I shall begin from this day to try & consider myself convalescent. Went off to
Church in the morning with the elder children. Harry came out a great swell,
some new clothes having been made for him by his mamma with the
assistance of the sewing machine & a few hour?s work from Billy Weeks the
Gaol Tailor & barber. Billy shaved me when I required it all through my
illness. He is one of the very useful men in Gaol who will work well &
willingly while prisoners, but who will do no good for themselves when they
are at liberty. Billy has spent three fourths, or perhaps 5/6 of the last twenty
years in Gaol, mostly on short sentences for Vagrancy.
Very lazy in the afternoon. In the evening wrote two letters, one to Ogier
& one to Mathews. The English Mail was telegraphed to Cape Otway this
morning, so without doubt the English letters will be delivered to-morrow.
Did not feel very well to-day; the fact is, the hard seat at Church was rather
too much for me after the long time I had been in bed or lying on the sofa.


I felt wofully stiff all this afternoon & evening. All the youngsters are looking
well & bright again [following the measles].
November 16 Monday 1874
Did think of going into the Office this morning but felt that I was not strong
enough to do so & be really useful so determined upon keeping away from
duty yet a little longer. Received a letter for Edwin Smith from his mother &
duly forwarded it to Campbell?s Creek; there were no other English letters
came to our house. Polly has made up her mind for me to go to Albury &
to-day bought me a portmanteau & some other things so that I might have
the necessary requirements for a journey.
In the afternoon I attended a meeting of the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society
as I wished to show myself about again. Mr Adamson & the other members of
the Committee who were present very kindly welcomed me. The weather
changed to wet before business was over & I walked to where the omnibusses
passed, under shelter of the American Consul?s umbrella. The Omnibusses that
passed were however in consequence of the rain crowded & I found that to get
a seat I must go to where they started from & so I hobbled as fast as I could to
the Railway Station; even there it was with difficulty I got a place inside a bus.
When I got to the nearest point to Home & left the bus I found Polly waiting
for me with a big coat & umbrella. My thoughtful spouse evidently feared I
should get wet & perhaps another relapse. In the evening Jardine Smith came in
& stayed chatting for an hour or two. He had just returned from Queenscliff
where he had left his children for the benefit of their health.
November 17 Tuesday 1874
Polly went into town this morning; while she was away Mr Sturt came to the
Gaol & I sent word that I should like to see him. He came into the house &
I thanked him for his & Mrs Sturt?s kind enquiries for me while I was in bed.
Mr Sturt advised me strongly not to return to the office until I had had a
change of air & approved very much of the idea I had of going to Albury. In
the afternoon Dr McCrea came in & authorised my sending word to Mr
Duncan that he advised my going away for a week or two. The doctor very
pointedly advised at the same time that I should not forego my application
for a long leave of absence. I wrote a private letter to my Chief & told him
that I purposed going to Albury in a day or two unless I heard anything from
him against my doing so. I said that as I was on Sick Leave I supposed there
was no necessity for making any formal Application for Leave.
November 21 Saturday 1874
Up at half past five in order to be ready for the train at seven. Poor Polly still
suffering terribly from neuralgia, she would however get up & go with me to
the Railway. Harry was to see me off but gave himself sulky airs & was sent


back to his bed-room. Sissy, Dotty & Walter went in the cab with Polly &
myself. At the Railway Station met Stiles the Manager of the Bank of N.S.
Wales at Melbourne; he was going up country for a holiday & chummed
with me immediately. I introduced him to Polly & the youngsters. Got away
all right, the weather soon became very hot & dusty. Stopped at Seymour for
breakfast, there was however very poor accommodation & very little to eat. I
wanted a chop but could get nothing better than a very dry sandwich. At
Benalla there was another rest & another sandwich, this time however it
was?ent a dry one & I enjoyed it thoroughly. In due course arrived at
Wodonga; there were several busses loading for Albury. I got into a very little
omnibus having accommodation for six persons; hot however as the weather
was the driver managed to cram eleven into the bus & to allow two men to
stand on the step behind. It is at the outside not more than three miles from
Wodonga to Albury, yet after the arrival of the train the delay was so great
that it took an hour & a half to do that little distance.
Mathews was unwell & Mrs Mathews was in Beechworth. Mathews made
me very welcome & I made myself at home. The evening was terribly hot &
close & before we went to bed there was some thunder & lightning; the storm
however passed away from Albury. Telegraphed to Polly to let her know I had
got to my journeys end in safety. With the exception of my shoulders & arms
I did not find my rheumatism trouble me & it was surprising how well I had
stood the day. Heat however seems to suit my complaint. Thought of Polly very
much & hoped her face was better.
November 22 Sunday 1874
Slept soundly. There is an aviary close to my bed-room & the birds by their
singing woke me soon after daylight. I managed however soon to go to sleep
again & did not get up till close upon nine o?clock. Mathews was still unwell
& did not turn out of bed till the afternoon; in consequence I had to dine by
myself, unless I must count Mathews little daughter, a very engaging young
puss of about five years old. I got on very nicely with her & she became at
times extremely confidential. She warned me against swallowing cherry
stones for said she if you do, you will die & go to Heaven & then you will
get nothing to eat.
In the train yesterday were Mr O?Grady & some other leading catholics of
Melbourne. They were coming to Albury to welcome the Bishop of
Goulburn who was to confer some order of Knight-hood on a gentleman
from Wagga Wagga whom the Pope ?delighted to honor?. I had no doubt the
installation would be made an imposing ceremony & just before eleven
o?clock I went to the Catholic church. It was however very crowded & I could
get no seat, so after standing for about half an hour & when I began to feel
groggy in the knees I sidled out of the chapel as unassumingly as I could &
went back to Mathews? house. Again I was much struck with the well dressed
well to do appearance of the crowd at chapel & pleased with the reverence


shown for the House of God by all who entered it; the catholics certainly
teach the Protestants a good lesson in this respect. Too frequently there is a
total want of anything approaching proper feeling shown by the habitues of
the English Churches, pew holders especially often swaggering into their
seats as if they belonged to them & showing by their manner very little regard
for the purpose for which the building they are in was erected.
In the afternoon Mathews took me on a hill & showed me the city from
its summit. The place looked very well at the distance we were from it & will
no doubt in the course of another generation be thickly populated like other
Australian towns. The streets of Albury are wide; there is much however to
be done in it before it can be considered a nice place to live in. The roads are
now several inches thick with dust & in Winter they must be in consequence
equally objectionable from the coat of mud that must take the place of the
dust, there is no water supply, water used being obtained from wells or from
tanks used to store the rain water flowing from the roofs. Trees grow
apparently very luxuriantly but none have been planted in the streets which
look very bare & desert like in consequence. The want of united energy
among the leading men is given as the cause of the town being very behind-
hand in the way of modern improvements.
In the evening went to the Church of England place of worship, there was
a very fair number of persons in attendance. The Service was very tame, the
sermon not brilliant but to the purpose. I put my hand in my pocket &
pulled out a contribution for the place; the gentleman however who collected
on the side of the church on which I was sitting did his task in a very careless
loose manner & I did not get the opportunity of adding my mite to the funds
of the church. Went with Mathews to Mr Gray?s house. Mr & Mrs Gray were
Beechworth residents many years ago. Gray is now part proprietor of
The Border Post. Gray came to Mathews & had a nobler, the three of us stayed
talking about old times till nearly midnight. After Gray had gone away
Mathews & I still sat over the fire & talked of gone by days; we retired at last
at about one o?clock.
November 30 Monday 1874
Before going to Mr Duncan?s Office I called at the Crown Law Offices & had
an interview with Mr Kerferd. I said that I intended going back to duty the
next day. Kerferd advised me not to do so but to wait until I was quite well
leaving things as they were at the Gaol. I said to the Premier ?There was an
article in The Argus about me on Saturday?, he replied ?I have not read it? in a
tone that implied he did not want to hear about it either. I then asked if there
was any chance of my being sent Home as had been suggested to report upon
the systems adopted at the Prisons in Europe. Kerferd replied that it could?ent
be managed unless it was recommended by Duncan. I saw that the Minister
intended to be reticent & took my leave. Got home rather tired & with
increased rheumatic symptoms.


December 1 Tuesday 1874
In The Age of this morning there appeared a short Leading Article strongly
advocating my being sent Home to see the European Prisons; the writer
spoke in very flattering terms of my competence to furnish an able report of
the different systems that came under my observation. Mr Sutcliffe called this
morning. Went to the Sheriff?s office, saw the Sheriff & was introduced to
Mrs Wright; the Sheriff & his wife were both embarrassed in consequence of
having no servant. The gentleman showed his hands which were blackened
& hardened by the performance of household work & the lady was lull of
bitterness at the independence of ?maids of all work?. The Sheriff wished to
get his family?s washing done in the Gaol but complained of the rates charged
for washing by the Department; he said he had spoken to Mr Duncan who
had promised to look into the matter to see if a reduction could?ent be made.
Felt tired and rheumatic to-day but in the afternoon plucked up & went into
Melbourne with Mrs Castieau; while the wife was shopping I visited the
Athenaeum Reading room, bought Punch?s Almanac & did not think much
of it after I had got it. Posted some newspapers for my father. Miss
McDermott had tea with us.
December 12 Saturday 1874
As I had promised Mr Duncan I would, I went this morning into the Office
& took over charge of the Gaol. Dr McCrea came to the Gaol to pay his
usual visit & I told him I had re-commenced duty. He said ?Let it be
understood I do not consider you are fit to do so & what is more I do not
think you will be able long to continue on duty[?].
It is to be hoped that the doctor is mistaken & that my constitution is
stronger than he supposes. I must confess that at times however I lose heart,
for the rheumatism hangs about & attacks me in different parts of my body
making me almost helpless as well as causing me a great deal of pain.
Cameron has tried to do me good by galvanising me. The battery, so far as I
have found, has not had any effect upon my enemy.
Being on duty I felt it incumbent upon me to go through the Gaol & see the
prisoners. I went from Yard to Yard & saw all who were in the Gaol & let it be
known that I was at my Post if any one in the prison wished to speak to me.
Visited Weechurch 268 in his cell & spoke to him about his defence. He
wished to say a good deal about the harsh treatment he was receiving,
complaining of Mr Duncan in particular. I declined however to listen to any
statements about his case & went away when I had personally satisfied myself
that Weechurch had all he required for preparing his defence.
268 John Weachurch (sometimes Weechurch) was on trial for the attempted murder of a Pentridge
Gaol warder. He had previously been under Castieau's care in 1872 during his trial for attempted
murder of Inspector-General Duncan. A brief account ofWeachurch's life and eventual execution
is in Denton Prout and Fred Feely, 50 Years Hard (Adelaide: Rigby, 1967), pp. 157-165.


December 14 Monday 1874
Got up feeling awfully despondent. I was so full of aches & pains, went into the
Gaol at nine o?clock & stayed there all the morning. In the afternoon Semple
called; I did not however stay with him as I had to attend a meeting of the
Prisoners Aid Society. When I returned Home Semple had gone away. There was
a hill attendance at the Meeting. Mr Wrixon was present; he asked about my
health & wanted to know when I was starting for Europe. He seemed surprised
when I told him that I was not going at all & said that he had understood it was
all arranged I should take the trip; he professed to think it would be a very good
thing for the community if I were sent to inspect distant Gaols & I told him that
I believed I should have been sent to England by the Government but that Mr
Duncan did?ent approve of my going. I said further that I did?ent know his
objection excepting that he had the idea he should like to go himself. Mr Wrixon
said he would see Mr Ramsay on the subject of my Leave. I do not think however
Mr Wrixon who is thick with Sir James McCulloch will press my claims in
opposition to Duncan who is particularly McCulloch?s protege.
Received a letter from my father this morning. He wrote also to Sissy & Dotty
& sent them each one of his portraits. I did not recognize the likeness when
Polly showed it to me ... The old gentleman told me in his letter that he would
be eighty four in January next. His picture gives him the appearance of a hale
hearty, upright old chap & he is represented without stick or spectacles. I could
not help thinking that he has more life in him than his son is in possession of.
December 15 Tuesday 1874
Much better to-day. The Supreme Court Criminal Sittings commenced.
Weechurch was put upon his trial for attempting to kill a warder at Pentridge.
I went to see if Judge Barry would have him brought into Court with his
Irons on as he was sentenced to wear them, or whether he would have them
taken off before the prisoner was put into the Dock. Sir Redmond thought
they had better be taken off, but gave me particular injunctions to have
Weechurch well looked after. Mr Ireland defended Weechurch & gave Mr
Gardiner the Superintendent of Pentridge a severe cross-examination.
Gardiner could?ent recollect much & did?ent shine in the Witness box; the
witnesses for the Crown were all examined & then at the request of Mr
Ireland the Case was postponed till to-morrow.
December 16 Wednesday 1874
Mr Ireland made a bitter attack upon Mr Duncan when addressing the Jury
on behalf of Weechurch; he said that the I.GI. had been afraid to make his
appearance in the Witness Box, though he was waiting about the Court
during the whole of the trial. This was very unfair for Mr Duncan would
have been very glad to have given evidence if he had been allowed to do so.
He was subpoenaed for the Defence, this was however only a ruse as it suited


Counsel to bully much more than to examine the officer. The Crown fell
into the trap & did not call Mr Duncan, relying upon being able to cross-
examine him when the other side put him in the Box. The Judge summed
up dead against Weechurch but notwithstanding this the Jury brought in a
verdict of Not Guilty. The verdict created general excitement & in the
minds of some even consternation. Weechurch was brought back to the
Gaol under his old sentence.
In the evening 1 went to the Legislative Assembly & heard a portion of a
debate upon what is known as ?the Flogging Bill?. 269 It is proposed to whip
Larrikins for larrikin offences, & the idea has caused much tribulation among
?the friends of the people?. So far as my belief goes I do not think flogging will
do much good, but I think it is much better to punish a boy by giving him a
good caning there & then as proposed than to continue as at present to send
him to Gaol. The cane leaves no lasting injury or degradation, the being in
Gaol is a reproach during the whole of a life-time.
December 22 Tuesday 1874
In the Gaol before nine o?clock this morning. Mr Duncan was here early &
dealt with Warder Lawler for being the worse for liquor on the 14th. Lawler
was fined �2.
Mr Duncan went through the Gaol & saw Weechurch in the Yard. The
prisoner immediately began to complain of the treatment he was receiving &
the rations he was allowed. The Inspector told him he could make no
alteration & then the prisoner spoke insubordinately. Mr Duncan as he
passed on made the parting remark to Weechurch ?that he was not fit to be
associated with other men?. This gave the prisoner an opportunity of being
abusive & he indulged himself accordingly, shouting after Mr Duncan that
?his Christianity was only skin deep? &c &c. I tried to stop Weechurch &
threatened to send him into his cell but at the same time thought it would
have been better if Mr Duncan had not made his last observation.
Weechurch is a great infliction, his mind is warped on the subject of his
imprisonment & with regard to it, argument has no more effect upon him
than it would have upon a post. He is cunning enough however to make a
mountain out of a very little mole hill & a splenetic remark like Mr Duncan?s
gives him the chance of insisting that he is goaded on to misconduct by the
authorities.
In the evening I went to the Athenaeum. On the way I met Semple; he
went to the Argus office to see if he could get more tickets for Blondin?s
entertainment & I went to the Reading Room to wait for him. In a few

The Argus, 17 December 1874, castigates parliamentary opponents of flogging as 'friends of the
larrikin class', among them a politician who had criticised the bill as 'born of a newspaper panic'.

minutes however heavy rain fell & Semple did not come for me; the rain kept
on & I was obliged to stay at the Athenaeum. Polly however was thinking
about me & just before nine o?clock in she came having trapsed all through
the wet to bring me my overcoat. I felt much the affection shown by Polly
but for all that I was wild with her for coming out on such a night & told
her she was treating me like a child & as one who could?ent manage in an
emergency to look after myself. The rain kept on all the while we were going
home & my over coat was a great advantage. Polly declared she never caught
cold & there was no danger of her doing so. We did'ent get very wet.
December 24 Thursday 1874
Mr Geary who has been for a number of years an Inspector of Schools was
discharged from Gaol to-day having been confined for some weeks on a fraud
summons. He has been in the Bail Yard, which is a very miserable place, all
the men there being unemployed & have nothing else to do but lounge away
their time.
Geary told me he should write a series of articles as soon as he got out as he
had picked up a good deal of information. I daresay he will produce from his
experiences something sensational but at any rate I am quite prepared to admit
that the system of sending people to Gaol in default of finding sureties is a very
bad one & that it is often very unfair, some men & women being kept for
months because they are unable to find a surety, an easy matter to others often
far more deserving of punishment. Tis a wretched thing too, the having a lot

of idle men herded together day after day & it must be very demoralising
especially to those who are enjoying Gaol hospitality for the first time. As a rule
the Bail Yard contains some most disagreeable fellows, for the most part men
who are wife bruisers or wife threateners & who are bound over to keep the
Peace. All these men should be at work, yet as the law now stands they are not
supposed to be anything more than detained & those employed work
voluntarily. This evening I went to the Athenaeum & then met Polly & all the
children. We went to the Arcade & visited a shilling shop where the youngsters
each got a shillings worth. Then we bought a cake at Duncan?s & then went to
the Eastern Market where the youngsters each had a pull at the lolly lottery.
Johnny got a basket, the others only hearts & such small prizes. Johnny in
consequence was somewhat of a hero for the rest of the evening. The streets
were as crowded as streets well could be & it was some little trouble to get along
with all our small fry. We got through however safely & as we were going home
had a capital view of Blondin?s fire works.
December 25 Friday 1874
Christmas Day. Up in good time. Sissy and Dotty each found under their
pillows a nice book. They were sent as Christmas Boxes from Uncle William
and Aunt Jenny. A sample of the Gaol pudding was sent to me; it was very
well cooked and looked good. Two of the cooks sat up all last night to keep
the pots boiling. Went into the Gaol this morning & made up my Diary.
Then had a game of cricket with the boys in the playground. Our dinner was
a great success, the threepennys in the pudding creating much excitement.
Four of them fell to Johnny? share.
Polly gave some dinner to the prisoners who mess with Cameron the
Hospital attendant & saw also that our own servants got a good feed. The
prisoners pudding was well cooked & and although it was not very rich it was
appreciated as an extra & thought very well of.
Mr Macnee and Mr Quin came into the house and had a nobler this
morning and Polly gave Mrs Gee a pair of ducks. In the evening Teddy Hall
came for an hour or two, the boys ran races & went in for a little fun outside
the Gaol. By ten o clock every one in our house had got tired and ready for
bed, so off we all went.
December 26 Saturday 1874
Boxing Day a holiday tolerably general in the world but a nondescript one in
the Gaol. The prisoners did?ent want to work but when I was interviewed by
the Overseer on the subject I found that in accordance with precedent they
must do so & directed that they should.
The day passed away very quietly. Semple called & offered me a ticket for
Blondin?s performance this afternoon. I told him I should?ent be able to go
& he then agreed to go himself & let me have the ticket for the evening.


Mustered the men in their cells.
In the evening took Teddy Darvall &my own Harry to see Blondin. 270 The
boys are getting big ones & there was some little difficulty in passing them on
half tickets, however what difficulty there was, soon disappeared & we all
found ourselves in the best part of the tent, a rude affair at the best open to the
Heavens with wooden forms for 5/- & no seats at all for those who paid 2/6.
Blondin pleased the whole of his audience, though he terrified to a certain
extent a portion of it. His feats on the tight rope are simply wonderful &
their very cleverness frightened a number of the people who were looking on
by their audacity. Blondin appears to be as much at home on the tight rope
as ordinary folk are on the floor & after a time most spectators get
accustomed to seeing him & lose the idea of there being any danger in the
pranks he plays upon the limited space at his command. Blondin forty feet
above the ground turns somersaults, stands in a chair when he balances on
the rope, carries his secretary across the rope on his back & does the most
wonderful tricks that have hitherto been performed on ropes a few feet above
the floor & from which if a performer happened to slip he would have a good
chance of escaping without any serious injury. Blondin wound up his
performance by wheeling a barrow to the centre of the rope, on this rope was
a grand selection of fireworks which ?the Hero of Niagra? lighted & at once
became himself extinguished in the blaze & smoke he created.
The fireworks were very pretty, prettier indeed than most fireworks that
have hitherto been shown in Victoria, the rockets being brilliant & of all
colours; some green ones were especially noticable for their novelty.
Saw Poole of The Age at Blondin?s; his son was with him. Introduced him
to Harry & Teddy. Felt the evening very cold & became painfully conscious
that I was still suffering from rheumatism.
December 27 Sunday 1874
This morning I was full of aches & pains & felt very much inclined to be lazy
& to remain in bed. Got up however & had a bath. Mr Mantell came early
& I went into the Gaol with him & stayed during the Service. Mr Mantell
preached a farewell sermon; he will not be Chaplain after the end of the year
as he is giving up his curacy at St James? & the Chaplaincy goes with the
curacy. I am very sorry Mantell is leaving as he & I have got on capitally
together; it is to be hoped that he will better his condition by leaving
Melbourne. He is to be curate at Essendon & to teach in a private Grammar
School there is established in that place. Mantell had some dinner with us &
we had a little talk about Harry. Polly & I would like Harry very much to be
under the care of Mr Mantell by & by if his school prospers.

1859.


I mustered the prisoners in their cells this afternoon. Quin gave me some
dogrell verses that Weechurch had written on a tract in praise of Mr Ireland.
The following is one of them:
The greatest warrior of the Law
That ever the Australian colonies saw
Our men from legal troubles to draw
Is the brave stout hearted Ireland
I will give the whole of the verses a place on the pages that were left blank in
this book during my illness. 271
December 30 Wednesday 1874
Harry?s head progressing favorably. Mr Sturt was at the Gaol this morning.
Gately the flogger, a great brute who would boil babies if ordered to do so was
sent into Gaol yesterday for some offence he had committed & his hair &
whiskers were cut off. He fairly blubbered this morning about the loss of his hair
& told a terrible tale of his troubles. Mr Sturt is however at times a very
unsympathetic man & showed himself to be so on this occasion for he sent the
gentle flagellator howling away without any consideration for his grievances.
Mustered in the afternoon. I had previously been to the West end of
Bourke Street to a Mr McPherson to see if he could give some corn sacks for
the prisoners to make in the Gaol. Mr McPherson was however not at home.
I wrote to him on the subject when I got back to the Gaol. In the evening 1
started for the Athenaeum & on the way there met Wheeler, one of the
reporters for Hansard. As we passed the Yorick Club some of the members
saw me from the window & beckoned to me to come to them. I went & was
demonstratively received by McKinley, Keeley, Harrison, Duerdin, Short &
others. The Club is now in much better premises than of old and I was
somewhat taken aback with the number of rooms & the great
accommodation. The place is not at all Bohemian in appearance & possesses
a billiard room & a drawing room. I have long had an inclination to be again
a member of The Yorick & to-night I was so heartily welcomed that I could
not withstand the temptation of joining & so paid my subscription for the
first half of 1875. Went to the Athenaeum & got a book. Mr Mantell
lunched with Polly to-day.
271 The full verses were entered in the diary page headed '26 September Saturday 1874'.


Chapter 7: 1877-1884
?Oh so weary of the world'
The diaries of Castieau?s last eight years map an increasingly despondent
character. He had struggled to the top of his profession, with much
disappointment and frustration along the way. Once arrived, there were too
many signs of indecisive leadership. Looking back some years after, a Pentridge
prison warder, Henry White, concluded that Castieau?s appointment as
Inspector-General of Penal Establishments was most unfortunate as he
possessed but few of the qualifications requisite for so high a position, and it
was also a matter of notoriety that he was of unsteady habits?. Within four years
of his appointment, things had fallen apart completely for Castieau. In the
circles that knew him there was, observed White, a general feeling of regret that
one so kind-hearted and generous should have terminated a long and useful
career so ignominiously?. 272
White?s reservations seem sound. Castieau was thought of well enough in
1879 to be offered by the Chief Secretary, Graham Berry, the temporary
appointment of Inspector-General of Lunatic Asylums in the absence on
leave of the office-holder, Dr Paley. Berry looked to Castieau to take an
outsider?s view of the administration of the colony?s lunatic asylums.
Castieau?s subsequent critical reports prompted a public reply from the
Inspector-General on his return. 273 Yet as Inspector-General in his own
department, a position at last attained in 1881, Castieau was unable to press
home the advantage of his position, proving vulnerable to internal
machinations against him, by staff at Pentridge in particular.
The diaries that survive from these years suggest personal circumstances
that weighed heavily on Castieau, to a degree that prevented him acting
successfully in his office. The occasional illnesses of the early 1870s became
more chronic, leading eventually to him being granted six months leave in
July 1884. Polly, too, suffered various ailments that feature in the diaries of
these later years. There is a sense of some distance between Castieau and
Polly, who is frequently called ?Mrs C?. At the same time the diaries more and
more show Castieau in a domestic light?a mutual regard between Castieau
and his daughters, Dotty and Sissy, comes through the daily record in the last
couple of years. This is especially so in contrast to the striking degree of
conflict between Castieau and his sons. In the last few months ol his life,
272 Henry Augustus White, Crime and Criminals, or, Reminiscences of the Penal Department in
Victoria (Ballarat: Berry Anderson, 1890), pp. 168, 176.
273 Castieau?s critical reports on the administration of the asylums, together with the replies to
these by the Inspector-General of Lunatic Asylums are in the Public Record Office
Victoria archives at VPRS 3991/P, Box 1164, folio 80/57393.


Castieau reports his exasperation with Harry in particular ('reckless', 'no
energy', a 'Frankenstein'), and Godfrey (at 18 years, 'a disagreeable age', 'I
have to bully him a good deal'). Recorded in the diary is a physical struggle
between father and son in August 1884 which leaves Castieau with a jacket
torn by the 'impudent brat' Godfrey, the one he had reportedly taken to visit
Ned Kelly in a prison cell at Melbourne Gaol in 1880. Almost the last
observation of the diary is a wish that Godfrey will get a wage rise to justify
his father 'insisting upon his taking lodgings away from Home'. 274
After the better part of a lifetime
in the extraordinary domestic
environment of a prison, the family
moved, in the last six months of
Castieau's life, to Inkerman Street
Balaclava, not far from the St Kilda
beach which figured so much in the
1870s diaries. The move was
predictable for one of Castieau's age
and social stature. By the 1880s 'St
Kilda had an aspect of ageing
gentility; a third of its householders
were not in the workforce, many of
them pensioners and annuitants'. 275
The Inspector-General moved
there on leave, and would shortly
become an annuitant. The weeks
following notice of his enforced
retirement were spent in an anxious
pursuit of investment possibilities.

in Melbourne Gaol' [J.B. Castieau Centre]

The only marginally well-off pensioner sought to secure his family?s future
through partnership in a small business. In this perilous adventure, which seems
to have come to nothing, Castieau at least appeared to benefit from his wide
range of associates, in this case especially leaning on the advice of the financier
and philanthropist, Ephraim Zox, who shared with Castieau for some years the
common interest of work in the Discharged Prisoners Aid Association.
Castieau?s last entry was on New Year?s Eve. Within a month he was dead
at the age of 34. The funeral was held the following day and Castieau was
buried in the St Kilda cemetery, where a headstone was placed in ?Loving
Memory? of the late Inspector-General. 276 Castieau was intestate and so Polly

was left to oversee the distribution of his assets. His sudden death at least
brought some financial relief. The life assurance policy he had occasionally
pawned for financial relief in the 1870s brought Polly more than �700; she
subsequently bought a house in Hotham Street, St Kilda where she lived until
her death in 1910. Some family stayed with or near her in Melbourne, while
three of the children (Walter, Dotty and Ernest) followed their father?s
footsteps by becoming gold rush migrants to the Western Australian
goldfields in the 1890s. 277
The death left unfulfilled Castieau?s wish to write up his own life, drawing
on the diaries he had so carefully kept and retained over nearly 30 years.
Symptomatically, the unfinished business is signalled in a diary record of a
negotiation with the listless Harry to assist his father in the process: ?I agreed
to give him a pound for a week to help me to look over my papers of which
I was to be returned 15/ for Board & Lodging. Harry has no energy & our
literary work did not proceed very far. I was cross & out of temper & after
the papers had laid about for some days, the girls gathered them up & put
them away again?. 278 In the end there was no time for reflection or
reconstruction, just the writing out of the daily record we see here.
October 4 Thursday 1877 279
After a very restless night I arose this morning unrefreshed and in very low
spirits. Things had come to appear as bad as they well could be in a pecuniary
point of view & acting on a solicitor friend?s advice (Mr Duerdin) I allowed
him to send a note to my principal creditors asking them to meet at his office
for the purpose of arranging my affairs. The meeting was fixed for this
afternoon at four o clock and shortly before that time I went with a sore heart
and a throbbing brain to Duerdin?s office. Duerdin put me into a room that
was not to be used for the meeting & I sat there for some time pretending
nay trying to read The Age of the day. I might as well however pretended for
I could?ent make sense out of any paragraph. Soon different footsteps could
be heard ascending the stairs & I could not help hearing the conversation
with Duerdin as there was only a wooden partition between his office and the
room I occupied. Seven or eight creditors put in an appearance and Mr E.T
Moubray took the chair. Moubray was most kind. Duerdin offered that I
should pay �lB per month and the Chairman who was my heaviest creditor
expressed his opinion that it was very fair. After a very little chat it was agreed
by all present that the offer should be accepted and that Mr Moubray should
receive the money monthly for distribution quarterly pro rata. I was most

kindly treated and did not hear a word said against me. Neither did Duerdin
think it necessary for to call me into the room. Yet when I got away I felt
dazed and slunk up the Back Streets as if I dreaded meeting any one I knew.
In getting home Polly was all anxiety to learn how I had got along. She
cheered me as much as she could and I could not myself but feel I had acted
wisely under the circumstances.
The pleasure of spending money affords after all but a very temporary
excitement. When that spending is beyond one's means, it soon to a sensitive
mind brings with it retribution of the bitterest kind. I have got into difficulty
mostly from buying when first I came to Melbourne more furniture than I
could afford, then borrowing to pay for it, then borrowing again from an
Insurance Company, the Alliance, then borrowing after a time to keep the
payments made up & so on from time to time, keeping on my legs by
borrowing from one to pay another, finding mysell with a little time to the
good but on each occasion in a worse financial position. Oh how the weeks
do run away between the acceptance of a Bill and its coming due & what a
terror there is of the approaching day when it seems as if there is nothing to
look forward to but a collapse & exposure. As for me I know that at my
meals, when performing my different duties, when reading or when
conversing, and when I lay down to try to sleep the ugly figures would keep
on intruding & my mind would stupidly repeat over & over again without
the power of any thought the difficulties I had to contend with. Then would
I toss & turn only to lay my head again upon the pillow to remain brooding
away until I took another toss & turn to be repeated over & over until
exhausted nature at last threw me into a troubled sleep from which how
frequently have I awoke from some horrid nightmare of a dream, my body
all wet with cold perspiration & my heart ticking like a watch. There is no
slavery like debt & there are very few who are in debt but have mostly to
thank themselves for their degradation. Credit is a curse to the majority. The
temptation of eating well, drinking of the best & being clad in fine linen is
too much for the generality of weak humanity &C so this is set down & that
is got and parties are given & unnecessary expenses of every kind incurred
with little or no thought of the day of reckoning. Certain however is that
reckoning to come and then the facing the little bills begins the trouble.
Creditors soon become less polite, after a while decidedly cool & after
another while request to be immediately settled with. Then's the time when
a man's affairs seem to himself hopeless and the world a burden, then the
devil puts into his head how easy it would be to lie down & rest for ever.
What shall it be, just a moment's pain. There's your choice of poison, pistol,
razor, or river. Thank God however that so many men though foolish enough
to get into debt and then mope over their troubles have still, if regardless of
'The Great Unknown', been gifted with sufficient manliness to save them
from the sin of suicide, for coward must he be who with wife or children or
both dependent upon him will desert his post reckless of the misery he will


occasion to those he leaves behind to fight the battle of life bear the whips
& scorns of time? the most of which their natural protector could if he had
done his duty saved them from.
July 23 1878 280
Although for some time past there has been a powerful party both in and out
of Parliament who have agitated for the removal of the Gaol & who are not
relaxing in their efforts to carry their point, yet I have not been able to realise
the idea being carried out as it seems so opposed to common sense to destroy
the expensive structure now in existence & which is centrally situated and
suitable in almost every respect for the purpose of a City prison, while it is
known that a gaol easy of access is imperatively necessary in Melbourne. 281
Still therefore believing that the Melbourne Gaol will not be removed from
its present site for many years to come I endeavour to improve any part of it
as if its remaining where it is was a certainty.
Carrying out this idea I determined to have some trees planted in front of
the Gaol; there had been some which Sir Redmond Barry had put in the
ground but which did not live. Two Wellingtonia Gigantia were obtained
from the Botanical Gardens & Sir Redmond graciously consented to plant
the fresh trees on hearing from the Sheriff that the ones he had set had failed.
After a lot of work in the morning in getting the holes ready, all was prepared
by two o clock which was the hour fixed by his honor for the ceremony.
At that time I went to meet the Judge & saw him coming to the Gaol with
the Sheriff. Sir Redmond?s continuations were a little disarranged & I
notified the fact to him by a pantomime action & a whisper of ?buttons your
honor?. Sir Redmond hurriedly adjusted his dress & then lifting his hat said
with a grand bow, ?Thank you; I beg your pardon Sir.?
The first tree was planted with great care; the Judge giving innumerable
directions of which as many as possible were carried out. Then Sir Redmond
remarked, that will do I think. If you please we will name this one ?my Lord
Wellington?. When the second tree had been put into the ground with similar
attentions, Now this one shall be ?My Lord Nelson?.
Four prisoners, all young men, had been employed in digging & running
about & the Judge noticed them favorably. As he was going away, he said ?1
wish you lads would work as well outside as you do in the Gaol. You would
all make good livings.?
Then I assured his honor I often made the same remark to the prisoners.
Ah it is a great pity?, continued the Judge. ?Now do any of you smoke? Mind
I dont advise you to do so, it is a very bad habit indeed! You do smoke! Well
it cannot be helped. As you do, if the Sheriff & the Governor of the Gaol
have no objection, I will inaugurate the planting of these trees by leaving for
280 At entry space no. 204 of 1877 volume.
281 The government had recently considered this matter, without resolution: The Argus, 11 July 1878.


you each a fig of tobacco.? The Sheriff & myself both said we?d take his
honor?s authority for breaking the Regulations on this occasion. The Judge
then took out his pocket book & solemnly asked each of the men his name.
They all gave Irish ones & Sir Redmond remarked ?Humph, all countrymen
of my own. Well lads dont come back to gaol again & remember this, if you
do & I have ever got any more trees to plant, not one of you shall assist me?.
Sir Redmond then went into the Gaol & left the money for the tobacco in
the Lodge. I accompanied him & the Sheriff through the Gaol & got a lesson
in pruning on the way, the Judge having noticed some vines trained in a
manner which he showed me entailed a great waste of wall. Sir Redmond &
the Sheriff were shown out of the Gaol by the entrance near the Supreme
Court & I went back to my quarters where I inaugurated the Christening of
my Lords Wellington & Nelson by partaking of some Whiskey & Water and
inviting Mr Gorman the Chief Warder & the warders who were about to
drink to the health & long life of the verdant noblemen.
August 11-19 1884 282
Left Pentridge for new house at Balaclava on this day. The mother slept at
Pentridge last night but the remainder of the family at Balaclava where they
had been for some days past. The house, considering all things, can be made
tolerably comfortable & there will be much less work to do when we have got
a gas-stove.
The fires seem now the principal trouble to the girls. Before leaving Pentridge
I tried to sell Carpet, Clock, Table clock & Saddles. The advertisement cost me
6/- & I only had one offer which I declined, not considering it a reasonable one.
I had great experience of the difference between buying & selling & saw how
easy it was to do the former & how difficult the latter. I sent a table to
Beechaump?s which was sold for �7.5. It cost me 5/- for cartage, 14/6 for
Commission & a shilling for entry. I was unfortunate enough to purchase a pair
of ponies from Mr Carton for �4O. This was nearly two years ago. The first day
the boys took them out a cabman ran into one of them & injured the pony?s
hip. The two however afterwards ran very well to-gether & I hope not to lose
more than a few pounds by them. 1 sent them to Mr Carton as a friend & he
promised to do his best for me. I got �22 out of which I had to pay �3.15.6 for
Livery, one shilling for advertising & two shillings for entry. My cheque
amountfed] to a little more than �lB. Moving is worrying work & if the warders
had not liberally volunteered their services & the prison vans were [not] placed
at my disposal I do not know how we should have got on without much more
expense & trouble. The Gas stove came in on Saturday & the girls managed the
Sunday dinner very well with it. New brooms sweep clean & perhaps new Gas
stoves cook well. Ours at any rate shapes as if it were likely to be a success.
282 Diary entries for the first part of 1883 were perfunctory and there followed a long gap
between May 1883 and August 1884, when Castieau resumed his recording.


Harry professed to clear out on Thursday morning last. He said ?lt was no use
staying here? & I thoroughly agreed with him. He asked for a few shillings to pay
his way & I have him a pound cheque for a weeks board & lodging. He did?ent
intend telling us where he was going to & did not intend to let me know.
He wanted the cheque changed and I had no cash. The girls produced 5/-
but he said he did?ent want all that & took only half a crown. The reckless boy
or rather man, he is Twenty-three years of age, then swaggered away without
any luggage little caring for all the worry & anxiety he leaves behind him. The
weather has been cold & showery all the time we have been at Balaclava & this
has interfered very much with the possible comfort we might otherwise have
had in our new Home. My annual Report was presented to the Two houses
last week but I have not seen it published & can-not but except it is too
favorable to suit the papers as my views in some things do not all coincide with
those previously expressed in the Press. In one case Flogging has been held
up as a panacea to check larrikinism. In the Report I profess that Solitary
Confinement on bread & water is in my opinion the only real deterrent in
dealing with criminals.
19 AUGUST. Ernest went yesterday (18th) to the State School; he did not
seem when he came back to have liked it very much. Mrs Castieau however
approved very highly of what she saw of it. Felt very ill all day yesterday
(18th) and went to bed early in the evening. The papers had very full
accounts of the boat race between Hanlan the Canadian & Beach, a Sydney
trained man. Contrary to all expectations Beach, to the gratification of the
Australians, won easily.
20 AUGUST. This morning Mrs C and Sissy have gone into town to purchase
some American novelties for saving labor in the kitchen. I gave her a pound of
which she was to spend ten shillings and of course she spent the whole of the
money. She bought a potato torturer. This is supposed to flay a potato without
cruelty, dirtying of hands, or inconvenience. I hope it is all that it should be but
at present the poor murphys are still skinned with a knife.
There is another combination affair, two pots in one. This is to do wonders
in the way of cooking two vegetables at a time; at present however I notice
only one comes to the table, spite of the Siamese twins.
This day (20th) I went into town principally to get my hair cut. This was
satisfactorily done and then I went to the office and saw Mr Brett. Found that
there had been a bother about our washing having been sent into the Gaol
this week.
August 21-24 1884
The girls went into town. On Saturday 23rd, I was very busy all the morning
trying to reckon how I stood. Had an appointment with Zox for half past


twelve. Went too late & did not get to the rendezvous till quarter to one &
so did not see him. I heard afterwards that he had come back so it was a pity
that I did not wait.
Came Home. Mr Adams, a Melbourne Warder, came out to help hang the
pictures, he was here all the afternoon & worked very hard.
Mr Gibson & his neices came in the afternoon, but they soon saw it was
no time for visitors & did-ent stay long. Harry then turned up wanting
money of course. He says he is staying at the North British Hotel, a House
which according to my hopeful son is frequented by theatrical people &
printers. I am thoroughly disgusted with Harry & do not care to brood over
what will become of him. He has no energy & only a bastard pretence at
independence which ends in a snivel & promises, which he forgets as soon as
his wants are supplied for the time being. I gave him �1.2.6 for a week?s board
& said now I suppose you will get along. He said if I dont get work I shall
want more next week but I replied ?then you wont get it? & I shall try to leave
him to his own resources. I shook hands with him however before he went
& tried to rouse him but I am afraid without success. If there was a
Frankenstein he seems likely to be one to me.
(SUNDAY) Mrs Castieau & Jack went to the church at which Dr Torrence
presides. They were pleased with the Service & got Home early. The girls
with the aid of the Gas Stove cooked a capital dinner & we all should have
enjoyed it but for the priggishness of Godfrey who gave himself airs to his
mother & has not the slightest idea how to behave himself.
He got me out of temper & I wanted to put him out of the room but he
is stronger than I am & there was a struggle in which my coat was torn. The
impudent brat shall not stay in the house if he does not alter his conduct very
much. In the evening the girls were going to church but unfortunately it
came on to rain & were obliged to stay at Home.
At twelve to-night a man came into the Back Yard & attended to the closet.
The dog did not bark much.
August 24 Monday 1884
War between France and China. Telegram of the blowing up of the arsenal at
Foo Chow.
September 2 Tuesday 1884
Received a note telling me the pay was ready. 283 Went to town in the afternoon
& got mine. Bought two pairs of trousers from George & George. Very much
surprised at the great show they were making. There was a capital band playing
dance music & there seemed to be hundreds of people walking about the show
rooms or sitting in the drawing room. As this was a show day no one asked any
visitor to buy. All were welcome to inspect even were they only spectators.
283 Castieau was on six months sick leave at this time.


Went to Moubray & Co. Saw Mr Rowan & ordered two suits of clothes a
hat & some neck ties. I was getting very shabby & can-not afford to be that
just now. Got home at dinner time. Received a Policy of Insurance on the
furniture. Paid Godfrey �3.13.0 for tea & sugar.
September 11 Thursday 1884
Received a letter that had been sent to Adelaide for Harry & which was
returned to the Melbourne Dead Letter Office. Gave Walter an order to
receive it. A pound was enclosed when it was sent to Adelaide.
Got the first No. of the Wangaratta Chronicle. It was sent by Harry & I
hope he has employment at the office.
September 22 Monday 1884
Received a letter from Police respecting Main. 284 The Report was that he was
penniless. Sent it to Messrs Gillott & Snowdon. Washerwoman here to-day.
Tuesday September 23rd to October 12th
Neglected to keep up my Diary. Have been very much bothered & latterly not
very well. Duly received pay and allowance for September. Paid Rent & as
many bills as I could manage & was several times in town. Harry turned up on
Thursday October 3rd from Wangaratta. Of course he was penniless &
thoroughly reckless so long as he could get food & shelter. I agreed to give him
a pound for a week to help me to look over my papers of which I was to be
returned 1 51- for Board & Lodging. Harry has no energy & our literary work
did not proceed very far. I was cross & out of temper & after the papers had
laid about for some days, the girls gathered them up & put them away again.
I gave Harry a letter to Mr Ferres, the Government printer. His answer was
that no men would be taken on until November. Not very jolly at Home &
saw it was useless for Harry to remain with us so on Tuesday I gave Harry
17/6 out of the pound I promised him & let him go. I day [i.e. dare] not
charge him for his Board. It is evident that he will not work unless that he is
driven to do so. He went away swaggering & defiant.
Have had several visitors & heard a great deal about the Gaol and
Pentridge; these establishments do not appear to be altogether abodes of
harmony although there has been a change of superior officers.
Gibson it is said will have to retire. One evening during the week I went to
bed about half past ten o?clock & seemed to feel in usual health. During the
night I was siezed with a heavy night-mare & in the morning found that I
had given my tongue a severe wound with the end of a jagged tooth. Polly
went to see Dr Stewart at Brunswick & he gave her a prescription which she
took to Keys at Pentridge & got made up. At Pentridge Mrs Castieau saw
several of the Officers and had a chat with Mrs Gibson. The good folks

profess to wish to have us back again. [This story was then repeated.] Suffered
with a severe attack of Influenza & Lumbago. Polly rubbed me well with
turpentine which did me for a time a little good. Left off taking what is
known as drink.
Mrs Gibson was in a great way about Gibson of whom Mr Magee has
reported that he is neither mentally nor physically fit for the position of Chief
Warder. Met Gillott in town. He has obtained an order to cause Main to find
Sureties for �23 costs before he commences his action. Dean O?Hea called to see
us. I put myself in communication with a Produce Farm in the Western District.
A partner was wanted with �2OOO. I asked for a reply through Zox as my agent.
One was sent but though it looked very well, Zox did-ent think it good enough
& so with his advice I left it for him to decline.
October 13 Monday 1884
Very unwell suffering from Lumbago. Polly helped me all she could but I got
worse &on or about the 15th had to take to my bed where I suffered terribly
though I got disturbed sleep at night by the assistance of sleeping draughts &
powders. I wrote to Dr Stewart but made light of what ailed me & told him
not to inconvenience himself by coming to see me. He did not come so I went
on using Blairs gout pills internally & Jacob?s oil externally.

Reproduced from The Illustrated Sydney News, October 1880, pp. 12-13


On Tuesday the 21st I was much better. Mrs Coffey came up in the evening
& I was glad to hear that Gibson was re-instated, Mr Magee?s forcible certificate
as to Gibson being mentally & physically unfit for duty not being confirmed
by the Medical officers Drs Stewart & Shields, but an entirely different opinion
to that of Magees being given of Gibson by both doctors.
October 22 1884
Better. Found Stewart?s pill rather too powerful however. Got up & dressed.
Wrote letters to Harriette, Emma & Mrs Hollaway. Sissy & Dotty went to
town to the Blacks. A Scissor & knife grinder came on his round, he got 61-
worth of work from us & we were quite satisfied to pay him for it. Mr Lindt
the Photographer some time since invited me to have a large portrait taken
to form one of a collection he is getting ready for Exhibition at the
forthcoming celebration of the Jubilee of the Colony of Victoria. I wrote two
days since telling him I had been ill & that I would give him a sitting if he
would make it as late as he could. To-day I got a polite reply asking me to
suit my own convenience.
October 23 Friday 1884
Got up very much better & went to town. Called upon Zox & went to the
Chief Secretary?s office. Mr Berry 285 was not there. I saw Mr Wilson & went
into my offices & talked to Brett. 286 There was an Execution to-day, a new
hangman name[d] Jones officiated &C did his work well so all the papers say.
Went to Lindts & gave him a sitting for a large photograph. Mr Lindt took
also one on a smaller plate. I was astonished to see how little trouble the work
appeared to give. Managed very well but was fagged by the time I reached
Home. While in town I had a cup of coffee & a pie at the Coffee Palace. It
made a very good snack & cost but sixpence. Bought Life of Sarah Burnham 1 * 7
(Sara Bernhardt). It is villanously scandalous & makes the great actress out to
be little better than a beast. It is however humorously written & I sat up
reading it till nearly midnight.
26 October Sunday - 1 November 1884
Went to Church with Sissy in the morning. It was Hospital Sunday & there was
a good collection. A stranger preached an appropriate sermon but unfortunately
the Rev. Gentleman was not able to speak his words very distinctly & in
consequence a good deal of his sermon was lost to his hearers ... Mrs Castieau
went out in the afternoon. I wrote up my Diary & read in the evening.
283 Graham Berry (1820-1904), three times a premier of Victoria, but at this time Chief
Secretary and responsible for the prisons.
286 William Gore Brett, whom Castieau had known since 1856 in Beechworth, was appointed
Acting Inspector-General in place of Castieau from July 1884.
287 Evidently a popular version of the life of Sara Bernhardt, the actress.


Monday 27th. Went to town in the morning & settled with Mr Goldstein.
Looked in at a Sale at GemmeU?s. Vases, China & ornaments were sold at high
prices, did not venture to bid & so came to no harm from my visit. It seems
wonderful, where all the grand ornaments can be sold & paid for.
Came home to lunch but went again to town in the afternoon & attended
Discharged Prisoners Aid Society Committee Meeting. Called upon Joe. He
had just welcomed Godfrey who arrived in a cab from the Brisbane Steamer.
Godfrey had his arm in a sling but was looking well after his accident. Chatted
with Joe about Harriette. He was much concerned because I had not been able
to keep up her allowance; assured him I would as soon as my affairs were
settled & I could see my way to do so.
Got back to Balaclava, Edie Cuthbert was at our house. No dinner had
been cooked & so eggs & bacon were got ready by the girls. Mrs Castieau
not well & upset. She went early to bed.
Tuesday. Awoke early & as it was too soon to get up read for an hour in bed.
Did not go to town to-day, read & wrote in the morning. In the afternoon
went to the Beach with Dotty. Troubled with a touch of cough & very much
lamed with a corn. Wrote a letter to Dr Henry asking him to send me some
tonic.
In the evening commenced reading again a book called Five Years in Penal
Servitude. 2 ? The book refers to English prisons & professes to have been
written by one who has served a sentence. It evidently is the work of an
author well up in what he has made his subject. Went early to bed.
Wednesday October 29th. Went to town this morning & strolled into the
Picture Gallery. Saw several new pictures, but none of them impressed me so
much as Esther & so I had the longest look at her ...
Thursday October 30th. Went to town with Mrs Castieau & Ernest. Ernest
was to get a new suit of clothes. When we got to town he caught sight of A
man he wanted to see? & made a run. He soon came back & announced that
his friend was Mr Wilmot & that he wanted to go with him & would meet
his mamma at one o?clock.
Mrs C & I then went to see Quin the old chief Warder of Melbourne Gaol.
We found him in bed looking a complete wreck. He was terribly thin &
evidently unlikely to get out of bed again. His wife had the place clean &
although it was morning the bed room was tidy & free from any
unpleasantness. Mrs C went her way & I looked in at the Gaol to see Mr
Williams who is now in charge as Mr Magee is ill. Williams was gone to the
bank, Mrs Gee away on Leave. I chatted for a little while in the office &
288 Edward Callow, Five Years Penal Servitude, by 'One Who Has Endured It', published in
numerous editions after its first appearance in 1877.


then left cards for Mr Magee & Mr Williams. Spoke to Gibson. Saw Julia
Gee as I was leaving and told her I had been going to see her mamma, but
had been told she was away from Home. Got back into Melbourne & was at
Balaclava at about two o'clock. Ernest had ordered his new clothes. Read &
wrote till bed time. Brought some Hop bitters, not the celebrated ones but
some prepared in Melbourne & which our grocer confidently recommended
to Ernest as being much cheaper & quite as good as the advertised American
mixture. Received a bottle of tonic from Pentridge. Troubled with a stubborn
cough after I had got to bed. Eat up some lollies I had by my bed side. What
1 thought was one more, after putting it in my mouth I found to be a
halfpenny so after a suck or two I disgorged it & went to sleep.
Saturday, November Ist. Went to
the office in town & got my salary.
Saw Brett. This was the Derby Day
& of course there were a great
many people knocking about. In
the evening read the papers. Rufus
won the Derby. Bargo was the
favorite. Jack drew him for me in a
Sweep. I of course had a flutter for
the money which of course only
lasted till the race was run. In the
evening I took Mrs C to see the
opening of the Jubilee Exhibition.
There was a Grand Choir of about
a thousand Victorian born whites.
They were led by Mrs Perraton &
sang very well. There was a good
deal of speechifying but it was not
very successful as most of what the
speakers said could not be heard
owing to their voices being lost in
the immense hall. The actual
opening of the Exhibition after
'God save the Queen' had been

sung was greeted with much cheering. Walked about but did not notice
much novelty. However was not able to judge what the sight would be as
many of the Exhibits had evidently not been placed. It seems rather strange
that spite of long notices of coming Exhibitions, they are never ready for the
Public on opening day. Mr Shadforth as the oldest Colonist present took the
principal part in the inauguration. There was some little ill feeling expressed
at the Governor not being present. The Exhibition is looked upon more as


a private speculation than a National undertaking & probably the Governor
was advised not to officially recognise it. Went through the Eastern Market,
it was nearly closing time but from the way a number of the stalls were
arranged it really looked something like a continuation of the Big Show we
had just come from. Got Home comfortably by the train at about midnight
& eat some sandwiches we had purchased in Bourke Street & which turned
out to be cheap & palatable.
November 2-4 1884
Monday November 3rd. Much confusion, my watch not agreeing with the
clocks. Went to the Railway Station & found that my watch was right & that
I was half an hour earlier than I wished to be, returned Home & got my
watch which I was sending back in dudgeon to the watch-maker?s as I had
only had it recently cleaned. It turned out that the girls had altered the clocks
by the Convent bell which had been ringing at seven o?clock, their not being
aware that the time from the first of November was altered to half past six.
Got to town & saw Zox. Came to an understanding with him. I had met him
on Saturday & asked him if he was going to the Derby. He said No ?You are
a pretty fellow? & then he was interrupted & we parted. This morning I
asked him what he meant & at first he could not recollect, but then he said,
?All I meant was, that you should ask me if I were going to the races on a
Saturday? when it was his Sabbath & he was the President of the Synagogue.
I told him that I thought he was going to upbraid me for something I had
done which had annoyed him. Gave him a cheque for some money that I had
borrowed from him a few days ago. Went to the new Law Courts. Saw the
Sheriff & Lynch & had a chat with them. Came home to lunch. While at
lunch received a photograph from Mr Lindt, it was very much approved of
by all at Home & the general cry was that I must get some more like it.
Tuesday November 4th, Cup Day. Started the boys who walked to the
Course from Town. Went myself. There were hundreds of people waiting at
the different Stations on the way to town but who could find no room for
them in any of the carriages & who looked very glum as the train rolled away.
Obtained a ticket for train & Grand Stand at the Post Office, though not
without a very unnecessary amount of pushing & struggling. Got a seat, or
rather standing room in a carriage for Flemington & arrived at the Race
Course all right. There was an immense crowd assembled & the Grand Stand
was densely packed. Was able to see but little of the races & being too timid
to speculate, did not have much enjoyment or excitement. Met Raecke & he
went halves with me in a bet I had made of five to one on Pilot for the
Darling Stakes. The only satisfaction we got for our money was to see our
horse run a good second.


The Cup was won by a favorite. It was a good race & in time that had only
been shorter on two previous occasions. Saw another race & then started for
Home. Some thousands were on the same intent & there was in consequence
quite a rush, was very lucky in getting a seat though to secure one I gladly got
into a second class carriage. Walked from Spencer Street to the Suburban
Railway & got standing room in a train for Balaclava. Home by a little after
six o?clock, very tired & as I had had nothing to eat or drink from the time
I started for town in the morning was hungry as well as foot-sore. Was just
sitting down to dinner when a cab drove up to the Gate & a policeman came
to the House. Ernest had been knocked down by a cab & struck by the box
of one of the wheels which grazed the lower part of his belly. A constable very
properly made the driver of the cab take Ernest to the Hospital where the boy
was examined by Dr Aitchinson who found that no bones were broken but
could not tell whether there were any internal injuries. I took the address of
the cab man & the name & number of the Policeman, a very intelligent &
decent man. Paid the cab-man six shillings. Examined Ernest who had been
carried to-bed. Did not think there was much the matter though he evidently
had had a very narrow escape of being seriously injured.
Mr Wells a neighbour came over to sympathise, told him I should not send
for a doctor until I saw there was any signs of the boy requiring the services
of one after having been already examined by a medical man. Had something
to eat & then read & smoked till after twelve o?clock. Visited Ernest & found
he was sleeping soundly, did not disturb him & went to bed rather tired &
slightly rheumatic.
Mrs Cuthbert & her daughters were here in the evening & saw the victim of
the accident. This morning before the boys started I gave Jack & Erny each half
a crown. Jack put his money into Sweeps & won a half crown one. Erny had
six ice creams. Well I said that will be only sixpence. Oh answered the sucking
gourmand, I had threepenny ones & then I suppose his distended stomach
gave the cab a chance to run against him & bring all the trouble Home.
November 8 Saturday 1884
Stayed at Home in the morning. In the afternoon went with Dotty to the
Exhibition. Wandered about the building & purchased a few little Japanese
articles. They did not cost much. We did not leave the Exhibition till we heard a
hint given to some other visitors that it was five o?clock & time to shut up. When
we got Home found that Sissy had returned. She had stayed as we thought she
would with the Miss Blacks. There was a letter waiting for me from the Under
Secretary informing me that the Chief Secretary wished to see me at his office on
Tuesday next, I suppose to tell me what has been decided about the Inspr. Genl.
ship. Expect the worst but will try & hope for the best. Edie & King Cuthbert
came to see the girls in the evening. Ernest was still in bed but I begin to think
he is foxing a little. Very unhappy, smoked more than usual & went to bed.


November 11 Tuesday 1884
Saw by this morning?s Argus that Mr Magee died on yesterday. Had an
appointment with Mr Berry this morning. He sent for me to call at half past
eleven & I was punctual. A Cabinet Meeting however prevented his being
able to keep the appointment & I did not see him till the afternoon. He told
me that I was to retire on compensation as he believed was my wish. I replied
that I had not said it was my wish but that I was willing to do so if the
Government wished. Mr Berry had evidently fallen in with the wishes of
intriguers & had listened & believed one side of the question without taking
any trouble to hear the other. He said that Pentridge had been in a state of
demoralisation & that the change that had been made had prevented a
catastrophe. I emphatically denied there having been any demoralisation, but
found it was useless my attempting to argue with the Chief Secretary. Saw the
Under Secretary & then came Home.
Had to encounter the usual cause of unhappiness 289 & spent a wretched
evening. Was cheered however by receiving a letter from Harry. He was at
Launceston & employed in the Daily Telegraph office. He wrote apparently
being satisfied & with the feeling that he had a chance of remaining at work.
He sent some wild flowers which he had gathered; they had been plucked
for some time but were none the less welcome for that. I wrote to him & so
did Sissy.
The Constable who brought Ernest Home after his accident on Cup Day
called ostensibly to see him to-day. I had meant to write to him & so was glad
he came. I gave him Ten shillings for his expenses & then found from him
that there was a charge hanging over him of Drunkenness & he wanted me
to write to Mr Sadleir in his favor.
I declined having any thing to do with the charge, but wrote telling Sadleir
Constable Rainey had done his duty in taking Ernest to the Hospital & then
bringing him to Balaclava very kindly & considerately. This seemed to satisfy
Rainey & the letter was posted.
November 12 Wednesday 1884
A Paragraph appeared in The Argus to the effect that I was about to retire and
Brett to be appointed in my place.
November 13 Thursday 1884
Went to town & called on the Under Secretary. Mr Wilson told me that I
had been laboring under an error in understanding Mr Berry to imply that
my compensation would be given at the end of my Leave. It was the
intention for me to retire at the end of the month & Mr Brett?s appointment
to date from the first of December. This did not suit me at all & I went to
see Mr Berry. He did not want to see me but I managed to get a word with
289 His ailment, likely gout.


him. He was very uppish in his manner & implied a great deal as to what
could have been brought against me. He did not however name any of the
charges that could have been preferred. I could not however move him from
the position he had taken up, that I was to be dispensed with from the end
of the month. Made the best of the matter & came Home to lunch. Offered
to take Mrs C & the girls to the theatre in the evening. They were glad to
promise to go. Gibson came to see us & had tea. He will make an application
for the promotion that will be necessary if Mr Magee?s death should cause a
country Governor to be removed to Melbourne.
Went to the Theatre Royal & had a nice quiet evening. The Play was The Turn
of the Tide & was as a whole rather a dull play, though Mrs Chippendale,
Harwood & Titheridge warmed it up occasionally & there were one or two
scenes that were really sensational. As we were returning to the Railway Station
we met Mr Zox & he kindly took the ladies to the refreshment room & treated
them to lollies & biscuits. We got home comfortably by twelve o?clock.
November 14 Friday 1884
Went early to town, saw Zox who accompanied me to the London Discount
Bank where I borrowed �lOO for two months to pay pressing liabilities until
I received my compensation money. Found however to my disgust that I had
to pay �6.13. or so for the accommodation. Could not however but submit.
Met Lynch & told him I was to retire. He said he should then go in for
himself as Ellis would have Brett?s place. He was waiting hoping that I would
return to duty before he did any thing himself. Met Dean O?Hea & friend of
his named Gordon. The Dean had had his portrait taken & under pretence
of showing mine he took us to Lindt?s. The Dean was evidently anxious to
see his own & only took us as an excuse. He failed however for his picture
was not ready for inspection.
Mine was said to have been sent to the Exhibition. Came Home to lunch
& employed myself in the afternoon in calculating what I owed & what I
could best pay. The Girls were preparing for a Party to which they are going.
It is to be at the Halls & is to be a fashionable affair. The Bulletin will
doubtless be represented. The girls came back at midnight. Jack was up at the
Station to meet them. The rest of the family were in bed.
November 16 Sunday 1884
The Girls brought Edie Cuthbert home with them last night. The young
ladies all agreed that the Party was rather slow & complained of sufficient
attention not being given to the introducing strangers one to another. In the
evening Edie went to meet her cousins who were to take her to the theatre.
Godfrey escorted her to town &as the cousins did-ent 290 turn up took the

young lady to the theatre himself. After the performance Mrs Cuthbert met
her daughter at the Station & Godfrey came on Home.
November 20 Thursday 1884
Received a letter from Harry. He spoke very satisfactorily of his position, but
a friend of his in the office wanted me to let him have �3O. Harry very kindly
but rather unnecessarily asked me to refuse & consequently I did so without
any hesitation. The friend is a person of some authority in the newspaper
office where Harry is employed. I trust my declining to lend the money will
not make any difference in his manner. Harry writes that he has been very
kind to him. If it was known that I had just borrowed for myself a hundred
pounds at 40 per cent, my declining would not reasonably be wondered at.
The papers announced that Mr Dwyer of Geelong was to be Governor of
Melbourne Gaol.
November 22 Saturday 1884
Jack, who is rather unsettled, went for a row with Euston Smith & another
friend. I gave him a shilling to pay his share of the boat hire. He has studied
very well and I gave him a scarf pin as a reward. I expect he will be Dux of
his school but if he is-ent I can-not blame him as he worked right well.
November 23 Sunday 1884
Went to Church with Mrs Castieau & Ernest. We went to All Saints & heard
the Bishop preach on behalf of the Bishop of Melbourne?s fund. The Bishop
was very eloquent. He spoke in terms of approbation of the energy of the
Salvation Army & praised the work they did in endeavouring to reform the
outcast & the vile of the City. 291
The bishop took care to assert that he did not always believe in the manner
they worked but fully approved of the motives which influenced them and
the valuable nature of the work they were doing their best to complete. He
hinted that the Church of England might well take a lesson from the Army
& strive a little harder to assist their ministers in the performance of their
endeavours to spread the Gospel.
The bishop gave some of his experiences among the ungodly up Country
& preached a very eloquent & manly sermon. In the evening Godfrey & Jack
went to town. Mrs Hall & her daughter called & invited the girls to a picnic.
Harry Hall who is from Bright was with some friends to take his sisters &
some more girls down the river for a row & were then to go on shore & spend
the day by the river.
291 The Salvation Army had established its first Australian stations in Adelaide in 1881 and then
spread quickly through the other colonies.


November 25 Tuesday 1884
Went to town & called at the Under Secretary?s office. Saw Mr Wilson &
spoke of the hardship it would be to me if my services were dispensed with
before the six months Leave that had been given me was completed. He
promised to speak to Mr Berry again on the subject as I declined doing after
having been to him before.
Called & got my book at the Bank. Went into Lindt?s. A fine picture of Dean
O?Hea?s was exhibited in front of the Studio. Asked about the Photos I had
ordered, they were not quite ready so I asked that when they were they should
be sent to my quarters. At the Under Secretary?s I met Mr Peter Wallace who
had come to speak of Gibson. Said all that I could in favor of Gibson.
Mr Peter was in great form; he is to escort the Governor & Lady Loch through
his district which is in the mountainous country of the Ovens. He promised to
bring the Vice-regal party back by way of Beechworth. Met Mr Bilson at the
Railway Station & we went together as far as Prahran. He was also trying to help
Gibson. We had a good long chat. On his leaving I said if I wanted any little
assistance (I meant with the Government) I should look to him as a friend & he
heartily responded his willingness to do ?anything? for me. Paid Gas account
�1.11.3, 2/6 of which was for rent of stove.
Mrs Castieau bothered me & we had some wrangling before going to bed.
November 26 Wednesday 1884
Went to town in the morning, called upon Zox and walked as far as the
Treasury with him. Went to the Sheriff?s office & saw Lynch. He had not
been well. Came Home & had lunch after which Dotty & I walked as far as
the St Kilda Cemetery to see Sir Mitchell?s funeral procession. Nelly a
little terrier dog was with us. When we got to the Cemetery found that dogs
were not admitted. Dotty carried her for a time but we left the ground before
the funeral arrived. When the procession had passed Dotty stayed outside
with the dog & I followed the mourners. There was not a large crowd & 1
found myself very close to Mr Gregory who read the Service. I forgot that I
had no sign of mourning clothes & a bouquet in my button hole until I saw
a reporter had spotted me & then I hid my flowers with my white hat. The
burial rites were soon over & I rejoined Dotty. We walked through Windsor
& Prahran and after failing in an attempt to buy a pestle & mortar which we
wanted we purchased a pot of Jam for four-pence & got home at a little
before Six. The Cuthbert girls came to see our youngsters in the evening.
November 27 Thursday 1884
Received a letter saying that my Leave was to end on the 30th June. 292 With
the letter was an account for me to sign for compensation to that date.
292 Castieaus mistaken entry ?it should be 30 November.


I signed the account & wrote a letter in which I said that I was greatly
disappointed at not being allowed pay & allowance money to the end of the
six months leave of absence that had been granted me. Saw Mr Brett. Dwyer
is to come to Melbourne & Fiddimont is to have charge at Ararat. Pinniger
is to Go to Geelong & Shigog to Sandhurst. The Governors at Geelong &
Sandhurst are to have �330 per Annum but without classification. Saw Zox
& appointed to meet him at his club on Saturday at half past twelve. Got
back to Balaclava by lunch time. Mrs Castieau went to see her sister Mrs Hall
in the afternoon. Jack a little queer after his examination work. Gave him
some Cockles Pills & hope they will make him all right. He had to come
home from school at dinner time as he felt so unwell. It was then I gave him
the medicine.
While I was in town I saw Lynch at his office & told him about my office
affairs being settled. Lynch was so unwell that he left the office with me &
went Home.
December 1 Monday 1884
Went to town in the morning. Took the Bus to Brunswick & then walked to
Coburg as the little Bus for that place was not available. Rather a disagreeable
tramp as the road was very dusty. Renewed my Electoral Right, found that
Mr Landells the Postmaster was the Registrar. Met a few of the warders but
did not converse with any of them. Went to the Penal Office & drew my
salary & allowance for November. To-day I am free from the Government
Service & must puzzle my brains in future to get a living. Met a newspaper
man who offered to help me if I followed the suggestion of The Sydney
Morning Herald & wrote a book on my Gaol experiences. He said there was
money in it. Went to the Bank & then took the train for Home feeling both
tired & hungry. Photographs had arrived & I sent one to Mrs Mair the lady
with whom Ernest is staying. Godfrey went to the Exhibition with Mr Beal
a traveller of the firm of Vial & Co.
December 2-4 1884
Went to town this morning, called twice at the Treasury. My account was not
quite ready. Went to the Library & spent an hour in the Picture Gallery.
Came home in the afternoon. Jack?s position in the School not yet decided.
Paid Mr Sutherland �29.15 School Account.
Wednesday December 3rd. Heavy rain in the early morning & showery during
the day. Went to town & called at the Treasury where I was paid my
compensation money, �2128.19.2. Met Zox and settled with the Discount
Bank. Was allowed �3.5.0 of the Bill for �lOO borrowed last month & Discount
at the Rate of six per cent on �3OO owing. Did not get back my Insurance Policy,
but shall have it to-morrow & a cheque for the rebate on the �3OO.


Paid accounts at Moubray & Cos., Raecke?s, Smythers?, Campi & Cos. &
have left to begin the world afresh with about �I4OO & with nothing else to
look forward to. My Life Policy is free again & that is a comfort.
Home at a little before three. Mr Morris the Landlord came & put a night
Catch on the front door. He wanted me to buy the house I am living in;
probably it would be a good investment but it is out of my grasp & it would
be foolish of me to scheme about it.
Wrote an Advertisement offering the Goat carriage & goats for Sale.
Godfrey, Jack & Herbert Darvall took in the Advertisement. The girls went
to the Cuthberts. Edie was at a Party at the Hall?s. Mrs Castieau went there
in the afternoon & met Miss Gampson a niece of Mrs Hall?s & this young
lady smelt the Party & expressed herself very viciously at not having received
an invitation. She is on a visit to town from Ararat. When our girls were at
Cuthbert?s, some excuse was made for Edie?s absence, but Sissy & Dotty
knew all about it & said ?now is?ent she gone to the Party?? It slipped out that
the truth was, when Edie was asked, it said in her note ?Mum to the
Castieau?s?. This was fine fun lor the girls as of course their mamma had told
them all that had occurred & what Miss Gampson had said in her presence.
Our girls could not have taken offence at not being invited as they were
recently at a Party at Hall?s & we have no opportunity just now of giving any
dances in return.
Thursday December 4th. Went to town this morning. Placed �7O to my
sister Harriette?s account in the Bank of New Zealand, wrote & told her I
intended doing so. Purchased some Linoneum for our Passage at Moubray &
Cos. & a lady?s chair at Cullis Hill & Cos very big place. Went up a lift to
the fourth story to select. There were two floors above where I had to get out.
Settled with London Discount Bank. They gave me my Life Policy & said
that they had sent Mr Zox a cheque for �9 odd on my account as rebate for
the money paid by me in advance of my bills. Took the Policy to the
Insurance Office & left it there to be registered as re-transferred to me.
Went to the Penal Office and paid �3.0.11 for labor done. �3.5.6 that had
been charged for renovating furniture was taken off the Account sent to me
as I had shown it was not due.
Gave Mr Stone one of my Photographs. In town I met Mr Williams the
Governor of Beechworth Gaol who is for the present acting at Melbourne
Gaol. He is going back to Beechworth in a day or two & I also gave him a
Photo to take back with him. Both Williams & Stone appeared much
gratified at receiving my likenesses.
Got Home at about two o?clock. The Linoneum came soon after. Mrs
Castieau was not very well pleased with it, but as the quantity we wanted had
been cut off the roll by my order it could not be sent back. Mrs Castieau was
not well but Jack managed to dish up dinner. The girls were away at the


Black?s. Godfrey went there in the evening. Made up my Diary before going
to bed. There was no enquiry after the goat carriage to-day. The Advt. is
however to appear again to-morrow.
December 8 Monday 1884
Jack was Dux of the School. He did his first paper at matriculation this
morning and seemed satisfied that he had done well.
December 14 Sunday 1884
Showery again. Went to Church by myself in the morning. In the afternoon
Sissy & I went to Hawthorn intending to spend the afternoon with Mr &
Mrs A.L. Martin. Met with a disappointment as they were gone out & were
not expected back till the evening. Reached Home in time for tea. Sissy went
to Church in the evening Dotty was not well & had no boots & so for the
two reasons combined contended herself at Home. Last night Sissy & Dotty
were invited to Mrs Jardine Smith?s house. It was raining but Sissy braved the
weather & went. She spent an enjoyable evening & did not get back till after
midnight. The boys went to town & saw Diplomacy at the Theatre Royal.
December 15 Monday 1884
Showery weather again. Went to town & called on Zox; he was very busy
& so I went away to look up Duerdin. After a chat with him, went to see
Mr McGrath to whom I had been introduced by Messrs Sinclair &
Macrehan of Chancery Lane. Found Mr McGrath at a large office opposite
Goldsborough?s. He wanted a partner in his business as a produce auctioneer.
He impressed me favorably & I liked the idea of going into partnership with
him as there appeared to be a very favorable opportunity. Told him I should
consult Zox & did so. McGrath had been with McCulloch & Co & also with
Monkton Synnot Brothers & Zox undertook to see these gentlemen & to
make enquiries of them as to McGrath?s character. Undertook to meet Zox
to-morrow morning.
Came Home. Met Sissy who was going to some Speech day entertainment.
Dotty followed her afterwards but it came on heavily to rain in the afternoon.
Jack completed his examination at the University but there had been a little
tiff in the morning between him & Dotty & I called him names & was very
angry so this made him sulky & I did not speak to him before he went out
again in the afternoon. Washing day. Weather & one thing and another had
made our place rather uncomfortable.
December 16 Tuesday 188
Went to town. Met Zox and started with him about the proposed business
between myself & McGrath. Zox called upon Mr McCulloch who would not
however say much about McGrath one way or another. The other reference,


Mr Sinnott, spoke well of McGrath & the chances there were of his being
able to make a good business with attention & energy. Mr S. said further, ?to
show how I felt towards him I made him a present of Fifty soveriegns when
he left my employ?. Zox & I then went & saw McGrath. We told him what
we had been doing & expressed ourselves satisfied with the information we
had obtained from the references. Then after a little talk in which we were all
apparently satisfied that we could come to an easy settlement, it was agreed
that McGrath should send Zox a written statement as to the state of affairs
as far as I could be made interested if the proposed Partnership was agreed
upon, & that McGrath should meet us at eleven o?clock at Zox?s office to-
morrow at eleven o?clock, in order that we might then go together to my
Solicitor, Mr Duerdin. McGrath said �SOO was wanted for the business & to
that I made no objection.
Came home rather behind luncheon time. Jack went to Speech Day of
some school. The Misses Black called to see the girls. Received a letter from
Mr J.K. Brown an old Beechworth man. He proposed to go partners with me
in building houses. His idea looked very tempting on paper & the business
would, it was remarked, be pleasant as well as remunerative. We could easily,
wrote my correspondent, build ten or twelve houses per Annum & sell them
at a profit of from �SOO to �IOOO each. I am asked to call at dinner time &
discuss the matter.
December 17 Wednesday 1884
Went to town to keep the Appointment with McGrath at Zoxs office. McGrath
did not put in an appearance and after waiting half an hour Zox sent his clerk
to tell McGrath we were expecting him. McGrath sent back a note expressing
his regret at not being able to come but would be glad to do so on the next
morning. Of course Zox was disgusted & I went away & told Duerdin what had
occurred. Then I went to McGrath & heard his excuses. He had been so terribly
busy. Had been selling all day &c &c &c. I spoke plainly to him & then
arranged to meet him at eleven o?clock the next day. He pledged his honor to
keep this appointment & I informed Zox & Duerdin accordingly. Went to
Balaclava. There was much excitement at our house as Jack was to receive his
prize as Dux of Carlton College this evening at the Athenaeum Hall. Went with
Mrs Castieau, Sissy & Dotty to The Athenaeum. There were speeches,
recitations & music, then the prizes were given by Mr Turner who acted as
Chairman. Jack held a most honorable position and for being Dux was
presented with a nice Edition of Prescott?s Histories. 293
Left Jack with his schoolmates & came home with Mamma, Sissy & Dotty.
Presented Jack when he got back with another volume for his library & wrote
his name in it giving my congratulations also at his college successes.
293 Probably W.H. Prescott (1796?1859) who wrote about the conquests of Mexico and Peru
and the reigns of Isabella and Ferdinand, and Phillip II of Spain.


December 18 Thursday 1884
Took good care to be in town in good time to meet Zox. Waited nearly an hour
for McGrath. To our astonishment & disgust he neither came near us nor sent
any word of excuse. At twelve o?clock we gave him up & came to the conclusion
there must be something behind the offer that he had made us & that he had
seen before our acceptance it must come to light & that he had therefore tried
to let the proposed partnership be abandoned. Zox was indignant & I agreed
with him that McGraths conduct was most ungentlemanly & unbusinesslike.
Zox acknowledged that I was entirely free from blame. After calling upon
Duerdin, I went to the offices of Sinclair & McCracken who had introduced me
to McGrath & told them (by their Mr Sinclair) how I had been treated. Sinclair
was annoyed & said that he would have nothing more to do with McGraths
business. It was arranged that he should see him & that then he would write to
me & let me know how McGrath endeavoured to excuse himself & whether he
made any further proposals.
Came home as soon as I had done all the business I could. Found that Zox
had sent Jack a nice letter congratulatory on his obtaining school honors &
promising that if he further advanced himself he would use his influence in
helping him if he wished to enter the Government Service where now
appointments were first to be obtained by educational testimonials. 294 We
were all pleased with Zox?s letter & Jack was of course in high feather. Rather
queer at Balaclava. In the evening took Jack & Godfrey to the Exhibition.
Spent a pleasant couple of hours. Saw my portrait among others. It is a fairly
good one. Home before twelve. The girls were sitting up for us.
December 22 Monday 1884
Selected a Birthday present for Mrs Coffey & a Christmas one for Martin.
These were books that I bought on Saturday. Gave Jack a painted Album &
a new Game for his friend Beal who has been very kind to him. Went to town
& first called at the Bank of N.S. Wales & was told the state of my account
& then paid half a crown for a 25 cheque Book. Called at Raecke?s & bought
some tobacco. Met Taylor of Beechworth & Dr Hutchinson there, had a little
Christmas talk. Met Zox. He had quite made up his mind that I had better
have nothing more to do with McGrath & said he had seen Duerdin & that
both of them had come to the conclusion that McGrath did not care to have
his accounts scrutinised. Saw Duerdin himself afterwards and he told me he
had consulted with Mr McDougall, an accountant, & that in his opinion I
was well out of the proposed partnership. Met Mr Cowderoy & chatted with
him. Walked through Burke Street & took a stroll in Cole?s Arcade.
Purchased a two-penny Xmas Card. Surprised at the number of people there
were about & at the free manner in which they spent their money. Bought
294 Jack subsequently became a public servant in the Chief Secretary's Department, Victoria and later
worked in the Commonwealth Customs while pursuing his literary and historical interests.

two Scotch Comic Cards for three-pence in the Arcade. The things were
cheaper &C fresher than at Coles, though they were not so well patronised.
Went into George & George?s. They had a glorious display & really their
place was turned into a glorious bazaar. They appeared to be doing a great
business. Did not buy anything. Went to the Railway Station but did not go
away from town, but went back to Collins Street & called upon Rowan at
Moubray?s. Had a seasonable chat & when I went back to the shop bought a
pair of pocket scissors. Met Dean O?Hea and went into George & George?s
again to show him the Bazaar. Asked the Dean for a present, but he said he
had no money ?only cheques, & she wont take them?. The she alluded to was
the young lady at whose stall we were standing & who quickly answered the
Dean by saying ?Oh yes, I will take your cheque?. The Dean however only
made me come along.
The Dean then would take me to Lindt?s Photo Studio. Here he admired
his portrait & paid for a Copy for himself I suppose. Mr Lindt had a quantity
of Kanaster tobacco he had imported & I got him to oblige me with a pound
of it at 7/-, the price it had cost him. Said good bye to the Dean & started
for Home. Arrived just too late to see my sister Emma & Godfrey who had
been making us a call.


Mr Gibson called to see us & stayed to tea. We had a long chat together
before he went away. Godfrey & Jack went into town with the books for Mrs
Coffey & Gibson. Mrs Castieau not well again. I am very weary and
miserable about her. In writing my Diary, I omitted to mention that on
Friday evening I went into town intending to be present at Hoskin?s Benefit
which was given on that evening. The theatre was however so crowded that 1
was unable to get in. The Heir at Law was the Piece played. I had a white
satin Bill of the Performance of that Play in which as a member of the
Garrick Club, I took part on November 30th 1855, nearly thirty years ago.
As I could not get in to the theatre I went to Raecke?s and smoked a cheroot
& chatted away with Raecke & Townsend who called soon after I did. I
showed my Bill & talked of the old times & the old Theatre Royal where we
played & which since was burnt down. A woman, very drunk & very
talkative, came into the shop with a pair of geese and after telling us their
history managed to sell them to Raecke for 7/6. This seemed very cheap, yet
Raecke shook his head & said he expected to catch it for his purchase.
December 23-31 1884
Went to town. The Place very busy, there being a large number of visitors
from Up Country. Came back early. Much worked up excitement in the
newspapers with regard to information being telegraphed from the Old
country as to Germany having annexed a large portion of New Guinea. I
expect there will be a number of telegrams before the real facts are known.
Called & had a chat with Mr Rowan of Moubray & Co.
24 December 1884. In town got a present from the grocer. Was upset &
foolish all day.
Christmas Day. Very ill, did not go in for enjoyment of any kind & did not
taste the goose or plum pudding.
Friday, Boxing day. The girls & Jack went for a picnic to Brighton. Godfrey
went to the Cricket Match between N.S. Wales & Victoria.
Saturday December 27th. Jack went to Caulfield races. 1 took a long walk
& came home tired. Mrs Castieau was out & the girls were disagreeable.
Went to bed very much upset.
Sunday December 28th. There was a large fire at St Kilda during last night.
It occurred at a Livery Stable near the Junction Hotel. Mrs Castieau got up
& saw the reflection of the blaze. I did not move as I knew there was nothing
that I could do to be useful. I saw the ruins this morning; they were very
extensive. Over thirty horses perished in the flames. Mrs Castieau went to


Church in the morning. In the afternoon the boys went to the Beach to see
the wreck of the Black Eagle which sank near the St Kilda Pier on Boxing
Day. Luckily she was able to land her passengers before going to the bottom
or there must have been a great loss of life, the steamer having left
Williamstown with 130 people besides the crew on board. Sissy & Jack went
to Church in the evening. Jack & Mrs Castieau went to the Beach. I took a
trip to town but did nothing more than a stroll through Collins & Bourke
Streets. Back at Balaclava by about nine. Wrote an answer to a Sydney
Advertisement & had it posted. Made up my Diary which had been
neglected for some days.
Monday December 29th. Went to town this morning. Called upon
Duerdin & had a little chat with him. Saw Zox at his office but did no
business beyond expressing a favorable opinion of the manner in which the
tender Board did the duties entrusted to them.
Home in time for one o?clock dinner. Much excitement with regard to the
Cricket Match between N.S. Wales & Victoria. Both sides have up till to-night
done well. N.S.W. out in first innings for over 400, Victoria the same number
or thereabout to-day for seven wickets. Went this evening with the girls to St
Kilda Pier. Saw the Black Eagle. She was lying in low water on the bottom.
Called & changed library book on our return. The weather this evening
was very sultry & the flies in the house troublesome. Godfrey went to town
to hear about the Cricket Match & took the opportunity of attending the
Opera House where he saw the eccentric piece Confusion played. Godfrey
liked it very much. It must from the newspaper reports be highly
entertaining. The watch dog through the night was a great nuisance & so was
an early cock. Sentences of Death on the cock & at the least banishment for
the dog were unhesitatingly passed by myself & partner.
Tuesday December 30th. The Postman rang the bell almost as soon as I was
out of bed this morning. Got a card of remembrance from one James Turnbull
whom I used to know many years ago. There was an Advt. in The Argus about
a partnership at Adelaide & as Turnbull sent the card from that City I wrote
& asked him to make enquiries about it for me. Sent with letter, Photograph
& card to Turnbull. Sent Complts. on a funny New Year?s card to Dean
O?Hea. Wrote to J.K. Brown. Looked over some old papers. Was indoors all
day. The girls went to the Beach with Jack in the Evening. Mrs Castieau had
been out in the afternoon & was not very well when she came back.
Mrs Coffey & Mrs Gibson came to our house in the evening & stayed till
after the girls returned from the Beach. Godfrey was in great form as the
Victorians beat the N.S. Wales eleven in one innings with five runs to spare.
The end of the game must have been a great change from the beginning &
the N.S. Wales were shattered most ignominiously in their second innings.


Wednesday December 31st. A very
hot morning after an exceedingly
close night. A welcome change was
however experienced at a little after
ten o'clock. I am about going to
town ... Went to Mullens &
purchased a diary & some paper, the
latter for me to commence my
Reminiscences on. I wish that I
could pluck up & commence them
at once. Met Garton & asked him if
he knew why that Mr Lemme had
never asked me for the money for
Walter's Premium. Garton knew
nothing about the matter but said he
believed Lemme did not mean to
ask. I am not satisfied however &
will see Mr Lemmie or write to him.
Went into Smythers & then at the
Railway Station purchased a shilling
book to read in the train. Mr Habbe
who travelled as far as Windsor kept
me chattering with him & my book
was not opened.

1896-1974, by Eric Reade (Melbourne:
Landsdowne, 1975)
Things were uncomfortable at Home & the last evening of the year was
spent most unpleasantly. Godfrey is at a disagreeable age. He was 18 last
month & assumes a good deal. I have to bully him a good deal but gain
nothing by so doing. He has been getting 15/- a week & I hope he will get a
sufficient increase to justify my insisting upon his taking lodgings away from
Home. 295 Jack is I think worrying about the results of his examination. It
does, no doubt, seem a long time waiting for the decision of the Professors.
I close this carelessly kept book. May I do better & be better if I live to
close one for 1883. 296
295 Godfrey Castieau (1866-1951) had a later career as the pioneer filmmaker Godfrey Cass,
acting, directing and producing silent films in the early years of the Australian cinema.
Among his films were two dealing with Ned Kelly.
296 This was Castieau?s last diary entry. He died at Balaclava on 25 January 1885 and was buried
in St Kilda Cemetery the following day.
